Great menus.  The problem is with execution and during these times (when everyone is having such staffing issues) this place suffers. Empty tables sat dirty so people had no where to sit. Two cocktail waitresses for the whole place and you can't walk up to the bar to order. So drinks came after we had our food. It's a great concept and I think once we can find people who want to work again this place will  kill it.,4,4/10/2021,Mindi A.,2,1,0

I think i've found my favorites. Skinny fats offers lots of classic burgers and sandwiches with a healthy twist. They also have some interesting side choices mike a vegan caesar salad and grapefruit brûlée. I tried the ""Chix on Broadway"" chicken sandwich and it blew my mind. It has a lemon herb aioli that compliments the veggies and chicken really well. You also can't go wrong with a brioche bun. On the side I tried the vegan caesar salad and grapefruit brûlée. I quite liked the dressing but it had far too many apple slices to be able to enjoy the whole salad. The grapefruit brûlée was a total win! Crunchy sugar on the top and sweet citrusy grapefruit made for an awesome ""healthy"" dessert. Colossal Lobster is another favorite mini restaurant in Hallpass. My boyfriend is a huge seafood connoisseur and he rates colossal lobster a 4/5. We have tried the Lobster ruben and the lobster roll. We really liked both, however the portions are small and don't come with a side. If you're looking for an elevated twist on classic lunch items, HallPass is for you!

Since I went on the weekend, it was busy but we were still able to snag a table. It wasn't cleaned yet, but when one of the employees passing by saw I was wiping the table with a wipe, he came back over with a clean towel to wipe our area down.

We ordered a tender meal with the second from the lowest spice level and were thrown off by the thick layer of spices that caked our fingers and throats. The chicken itself was tender but coughing at one of the lowest spice levels when our spice tolerance is high was concerning. The fries were okay and the soda options were interesting.For baos: We ordered the Szechuan chicken dumplings (order of 5) and the pork belly baos (order of 2). Overall a good price for the portions but it left me wanting more. Everything was made to order but the dumplings were cool when we picked them up.

I haven't been to SLC in over a year so I was happy to find a new place to try while we're in town. It's cafeteria style so seat yourself. Go to restaurant stations, order, and pay then wait for your buzzer to go off. You do need to order your beer at the table by pushing the button though. I'm a fried chicken girl and so I was really looking forward to Blaze of Thunder. I was bummed to find out that they stopped serving bone in chicken :( so they only have sandwiches and tenders. I'll just have to stick to Pretty Bird for my Nashville bone in chicken. I got the tenders in ""too fast"" and they sure were spicy. I only ate one piece before I started crying. The meal came with a side which I opted for the banana pudding with banana cotton candy. Yum yum yum my toddler and I loved this. It was really creamy with a light banana taste that's not over powering. As a fried chicken girl I also tried ""general Tso's chicken wings"" at Graffiti Bao. It came with 6 party wing pieces, pickled carrots strips, and a dipping sauce. I thought these wings were a bit overcooked (chewy and dry) and there was too much sauce. If there's gonna be that much sauce there needs to be some rice to sop with all up. My husband had the ""fish and seashore fries"" from Codspeed. He thought the fish was okay. The fish was lightly battered and tasted like fish. My tween had the ""classic burger"" from SkinnyFats and she enjoyed her meal. She said the burger was nicely cooked (they asked and we requested medium well). She got truffle fries and I thought they were one of the best I've truffle fries I've tasted. Very light truffle flavor so it doesn't over power your pallet. They used parmesan crumbles instead of shaved or grated parmesan so it may not be as fancy.  My husband tried to order beer at the bar counter but you actually order from a waiter at your table. You push the button to get service or in my husband's case had a waiter follow him to the table. He had the ""coconut stout"" and he liked it. He thought it tasted like a good stout but there was nothing really outstanding. His favorite coconut beer is from Kona Brewing. Overall our experience was nice. Everyone wore masks as they were walking around. The tables were well spaced out. The staff were friendly and attentive. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a manager or supervisor of some sort. Showed us the ropes and politely left. Throughout our stay (about an hour) the staff came up to us 4-5 times asking how everything was. Overall I recommend this place for large groups or indecisive people.

The point is, I felt like a real food critic to get the inside scoop for my fellow foodies. If you know me, you know I love my chicken wings. So I had to try the General Tso's wings. Wings mixed with one of my favorite spice? I couldn't pass up on that. The first bite was aaammmazing, it was crispy and juicy and full of flavor. The only downside is I wish it was spicier (personally for me). But overall, the wings did not disappoint! Next, your girl had to try the fries. Can't say no to carbs. The crispy chili garlic fries with pork belly, hits you hard in the heart (like full of goodness and probably health wise). But the pork belly was very tender, and the fries with the chili garlic had an Asian kick to it. You can't go wrong with fries, and the pork belly was the cherry on top. You have the option of adding the pork belly or not, so don't feel pressure. Last but not least, the Graffiti Burger... omg like one of the best burger I have ever had. I believe it had coleslaw in it. So if you're a fan, you're going to love this burger. It was so good, I don't even have the words to describe it.

I love the idea of one place having a variety of food options for everyone. This is the grown-up version of a food court. That being said, it's still family friendly, but it has a trendy vibe. When you walk in you're greeted by a host who, for new comers, will explain a little bit about the place, where to go, and how to find what you're looking for. Basically, wind through the loop of restaurants, figure out what sounds good, and order from as many places as you want. Once you order you're handed a buzzing number that will notify you when to pickup your food. There's seating throughout the place including single tables, communal tables, and patio seating. They also have a few soda stations throughout, but be warned, this is not a traditional Coke or Pepsi soda machine. Their soda fountains remind me of the ones at Blue Lemon. Handcrafted, natural, unique sodas... The ""healthier"" versions. My initial reaction at the sofa machine was slight disappointment (I'm a Diet Coke girl), but ended up really enjoying mixing a couple sodas. And yes, several refills were involved. Another cool feature is that each table has a button to push for bar service. Once pushed a server will approach to get your bar order. They have a pretty good selection and offering of cocktails, spirits, and beer. My friend and I had so much fun hanging out there and overeating! A really fun environment that got even more fun with a DJ spinning around 9 or 10pm. I think Colossal has the best Lobster Roll in SLC. The toasted buttery bun, finely chopped celery, big chunks of lobster, and a light dressing of mayo spread made it perfectly delicious. The Szechuan Dumplings were far more addicting than I anticipated. And the spring rolls that you wrap with lettuce, jalapeno, thai basil, mint, and some pickled veg make the fried roll seem lighter and more balanced. Plus you get to add as much or as little of the accoutrements as you want, making it customizable to your specific taste. So the food is amazing, vibe is fun, drink game (soda or alcohol) is strong, and the staff is so friendly and high energy. No judgey Abercrombie/Hollister vibe here! Everyone was great at answering questions and making suggestions. Our cocktail waitress was the best too. We ended up hanging out there for like 4 or 5 hours. Such a fun place!

Loved my buffalo chicken salad. I'm not a ranch fan so I had that put on the side. The burger was amazing and don't skip on the truffle fries. And get the SkinnyFats sauce too.

Parking underground in the mall parking was fine, and it didn't take us long to find our way to the store. The exact opening and closing times are in flux right now, but they were attentive and had a great focus on service and safety. After a short wait we got in. They have a large space with a variety of places to sit and dine, and some beautiful murals and outdoor seating to enjoy. It is kind of like a food court, but where all the restaurants are food truck owners. The availability varies from day to day. We had the options of seafood, spicy chicken sandwiches, and rice bowls, all of which looked good. We got the lobster roll and the More Cow Bowl which were both excellent. Good ingredients, good quality, a bit pricey, like most food truck fare. The rice bowls for takeout are different than the dine-in so be sure to get your order to go if you think you won't finish it and want to save the rest for leftovers. They have bathrooms and I heard there's a secret room you can book for private dining. They will offer drinks if you sit up front by the Zombies bar. My companion enjoyed the Berry Me mixed drink. The drink menu is only viewable via QR code though. Overall everything was good and clean, 5 star service, and 5 star food.",5,6/14/2020,Josh J.,1,1,0

When we walked in we seen four people walking around with radios in their ears and acting like they ran the place.  We received sad efforts at smiles and then watched them walk off talking with each other.  No effort to help.  The seating when there are lots of people is not convenient.  If HP doesn't figure out how to make the seating that will accommodate the non-hipster solicitor, I think a year from now the Gateway lease agreement will seem difficult to justify.When we tried to figure out what was served at some of the other vendors we felt like we were in the way of traffic.  The distance between seating and the fronts of the small restaurants is not accommodating. I actually sent a message to HP on yelp to see if there were online menus so this exact situation wouldn't happen.  In short I was told all of the restaurants had rotating menus so it wasn't an option.  Funny thing is there is now menus for most of the restaurants online, funny how that occurs.As much as I want to see this HP work, it will not work if they don't think more in line with serving the type of visitor that returns and not just a small fickle hipster group that will be gone as soon as next new thing pops up.Two stars for the fact that I do like SkinnyFats food.",2,3/19/2020,Randy H.,1,1,2

SLC isn't exactly a culinary capital so you should automatically lower your expectations wherever you go there. If you enjoy pretentious restaurants with trendy ambiance, you'll probably like this place. If you're a weary traveler looking for a respite and a well-rounded meal, then perhaps not. I ended up there against my will as it was one of the few places open past 9pm in SLC.  The menu was full of overpriced items which I assume some people enjoy, but as I didn't have a hankering for bone marrow or gazpacho, I settled for a burger and ""steak fries."" The steak fries tasted fine and were cooked well, but they were more like potato wedges than anything resembling a fry. The burger was lackluster at best and downright weird at worst. Again, partially my fault for ordering medium-well and expecting it to be cooked medium-well, but it was cooked until it was extra dead, and THEN some. This resulted in a springy and somewhat flavorless burger. The caramelized onions clearly had been caramelized using brown sugar which is both uncharacteristic and terrible. They tasted almost candied in the worst way. I did not finish the burger. Please stop doing this to onions. They deserve better. After a 40 minute wait for a table, another 15 minutes before our order was taken, and another 25ish minutes before our food arrived at our table, this was a long and slightly annoying experience. This was due in part to the table of loud, college-aged hipsters next to us who asked me to take a photo on a disposable camera, which they clearly believed was an interest piece. In response to a simple question about the film count, I received a scornful glance dripping with teenaged superiority over my perceived inability to work a ""vintage"" camera. It was simultaneously amusing and nauseating. They were not entirely to blame, however. Our server was adequate but brusque at best, with the kind of demeanor that made you question yourself for asking for ketchup. Also, the white cloth napkin had lipstick stains. Gross.

Definitely consider calling ahead for reservations, as seating is small and limited in this nicely designed, almost farmhouse chic atmosphere. Parking is super easy if you can get the spots across the street, and parking during the week is free after 8pm. Its seemingly very popular, as i came here on a Tuesday and it was packed. I once tried coming here before, but the wait was so long, that it really only made sense to come with reservations. I ordered the Mary's Cast Iron Chicken - which according to the waiter was an 'right-on! excellent choice' - from his reaction; I was excited and ready to be wowed! Except I was underwhelmed and left hungry and disappointed afterwards. The meal fell below my own expectations - If i hear 'cast iron' my mind goes to crisp chicken skin, with a taste and seasoning that you can only get from a well seasoned cast iron pan. Instead, I got wet chicken skin with mild brown seasoning, that sat in a bowl with a mix of veggies, some sort of raisin or dried berry, swimming in a thing unflavored broth. It basically felt like I was eating a chicken breast in a shallow bowl of veggie soup. Oh, and it wasn't even served in a cast iron pan - it was served in a bowl. Totally boring meal - (see pic). I give this place a 2-Star because the service was pretty good, I did enjoy the appetizer/small plates that they had - the bone marrow dish was interesting and flavorful, fried cauliflower was pretty good as well. The shisito peppers were borderline, I felt like they should have bought smaller ones, as the larger shishito peppers tend to have larger seeds which isn't always the best thing to chew on and get stuck in your teeth. Would I come back, ehh I 'might' only if someone else drags me here - i know I just wont order Mary's Wet Chicken Soup.",2,3/15/2020,Von A.,2,4,3

And it's strictly because I was so underwhelmed on my last visits. But it was time to go back to see if my opinion had changed!Here's what I can award 5 stars:1. The house made salsa is phenomenal. In my opinion it's exactly how salsa should be; slightly spicy and blended to perfection. 2. The refried beans are creamy, well-seasoned, and the perfect addition to every dish on the menu. It's basically bean dip, which is what makes it killer. 3. Speaking of killer, anything with ""Killer"" in its name on the menu is just that. Absolutely killer. Follow the killer on the menu and you'll be sitting pretty. 4. The cocktails are delightful! We had the mojito and that rum-horchata concoction (sorry, I forgot the name) and we were in alcoheaven. 5. And lastly, the service. Our server Tony was incredibly kind, attentive, and cool as he juggled all of his demanding tables while still being a great host to our table of two. Here's what I cannot award 5 stars:1. The store bought tortilla chips/tortillas. They're good but come on! I expect house-made chips and tortillas when I'm dining at one of Utah's best Mexican restaurants.2. The wait time. It's good Mexican food, but I'm not sure it's wait 30-90 minutes to be seated good. 3. The extra fees for things like smothered style and cheese. $4.19 for Chile verde? $2.29 to add cheese? Absolutely ridiculous. 4. Maybe it's just me, but the ""salsa espanola"" tastes a lot like the sauce in Spaghettio's or Chef Boyardi canned pasta. Not my favorite. Ultimately, Red Iguana offers a unique dining experience and a one-of-a-kind Mexican menu in Utah. It's worth trying at least once to see if you're one of  the die-hard fans or a one-time visitor.

Every time. Perhaps the Cardenas family should consider a culinary school to encourage young cooks/chefs/entrepreneurial restauranteurs? No one should selfishly hope the the great American temptation which comes to all excellent restauranteurs to franchise can be resisted for at least another generation, yet we do.  Because this notion of handing down the recipes of this eclectic and diverse menu to the philistines who will inevitably take the company public and run it into the cost-saving-terrain of cheapening both the product and the service will inevitably prevail.  Witness Chili's on Greenville Avenue in Dallas in 1975.  I was there.  Completely unrecognizable in content or service today.  Yet, the Cardenas family who has been involved in the grueling business of running a (now 3) restaurant empire for more than 50 years, might choose to reap the rewards of their business acumen and their recipes with a franchise agreement.  No one could dare blame them.  I just selfishly hope it's not on my watch.",5,12/26/2020,John C.,0,0,0

It is a very trendy and 'buzzy' restaurant - good for date night, friends dinner,  etc. FOOD: The menu here is extensive and there are many great options. For appetizers we ordered the arugula salad, beet salad, egg n chips, duck wings and brussel sprouts. The standout for me was the brussel sprouts. The duck wings were OK but the kimchi did not really jive with the blue cheese spread. The egg n chips r amazing in theory (if you love eggs and chips like I do!) but u ultimately end up with soggy chips. The arugula salad was really simple (just arugula, lemon juice, Parmesan), but quite tasty. The beet salad was delicious!For entrees we had the croque madam, the patty melt, the wagyu cheeseburger and the gnocchi.

We had to walk back to the car to get them because this was completely unexpected at 4:30pm to enter a restaurant for food. We come back and show our ids. My mom's ID is expired; she had a paper extension, but not on her because come on, she's an elderly citizen, she obviously looks older than 21. We are allowed in.We haven't made it to our table when the manager started whispering about us with the hostess, assuming regarding the expired ID, then proceeded to stop my husband midway to our table by the bar to tell him expired IDs are not accepted. My husband clarifies and we keep going. Still we find it rude because we felt profiled; but ok. There's 2 tables in the whole restaurant, you'd think they'd try harder at customer service...Our server Erica comes, we order a bottle of Cava right away and a beer. We are in the industry- we won't be ordering a $300 bottle of wine; but $45 worth of drinks by the time we are sitting down sounds pretty good to most servers. She comes back to struggle to open the sparkling and while she's at it, we ask her what the oysters are. She doesn't know. We ask her for the fish of the day; which is on the menu like that. She doesn't know either. We ask her for any specials, she says she has to check. With the Cava we get 10% ice in the ice bucket, and a warm bottle. When she comes back to tells us what the oysters are, we go ahead and order 6 oysters. Oysters take forever, we have to flag her down and ask her because of our fear that everything will come at once. We finally get them. Of course we get 12 instead of 6.  One of us isn't having any so I have to tell the manager when he drops them off that we only wanted 6. His response: ""oh, well enjoy them."" Really? Language can be powerful.We ordered 3 burgers because being in the industry I choose not to give money to places that don't care to have me there, and at this point I have already ordered plenty for the kind of service we have gotten. As expected, as she's taking the order and as she realizes is going to be 3 burgers, she smirks and laughs and walks away. Burgers were all 3 different temperatures, but all 3 were overcooked and wrong. She comes back right after our burgers were dropped, our oysters were still there because we had literally just gotten them and she says: ""I heard you were asking for the specials"", Um no, you didn't ""hear"", I asked you directly. And then asked someone else when you never came. So I tell her tht and she proceeded to avoid us the rest of the meal. We never got water refills even though our glasses were empty, we poured our own wine the whole time, our table was never bussed- we piled up the plates and moved them to a corner, and they remained there until the end.But this whole time the bouncer/manager was worried about my mom's ID being expired. Talk about priorities.We get the check and the oysters had been corrected, but of course not comped. I never worked in a restaurant where the managers wouldn't have automatically just taken care of those $18 for being wrong; late and rushed: but not here.The area is horrible; I don't know the city but the amount of homeless, meth addicts and weirdos around the restaurant is a little concerning. Again, you'd think these people would try harder to keep customers. The only person that seemed to know their job duties and any customer service was the bartender. We saw him telling the server to give us more water. We saw him taking care of tables that were neglected. We saw him sending the servers to our table to pick up the credit card, etc. So as we are walking out we gave part of the server's tip to the bartender and thanked him for trying to take care of us.

Finally somewhere that doesn't circle jerk each other over a plate of short ribs and bavette steak. Carson is new American but with a ever apparent southern flare. They do their style and don't care what you think. Go with an open mind and enjoy. If I see you get a burger and say it isn't good enough to go back then you have zero respect from me or any other person. The bottom line is that they have fun, unique and delicious menu that will satisfy you. If you're a cheap son of a bitch that doesn't want to spend more than $20 per person than go elsewhere.  If you love good food take a $100, a date, and enjoy. Bacon jam: off the charts. Loved the pepper on the bread too, nice subtle addition that not many would notice but it takes the flavor to never never never land. Shrimp: great. I loved the red jalapeños. Is there a difference? I wish there were more to get into every bite, it brought it together.  I think they were 8Fresno. Cut the jalapeños, use more Fresno. Chicken skins: delicious honey. The chicken skins were hard to eat, very crunchy. Delicious, but just too crunchy for me. Hurt my mouth and the honey is served too shallow to actually dip the skins. There is a better way to serve this thatd be more conducive to eating and not looking. Pork belly: great. Loved the carrots and Buffalo spin. Delicious. Perfect. Beets: fresh, light. Loved the pistachios rolled INTO the goat cheese. Made it easy to eat and come together. Wished there was a few more oranges. Mac and cheese: smooth, thin and sharp. Great stuff. I'd love an herb. Something to make it kick but otherwise wonderful. Just a little blan but not badBread salad: deliciousChicken: wonderfully tender, perfectly cooked. The sauce needed more power in my opinion. It was missing a kick: citrus, spice or otherwise. I could be totally wrong but it seemed muddled. It was very fun to eat and it was good BUT compared to the other dishes, this one lacked the coherent and boastful flavors. Turns out it was supposed to have a mustard taste and that would've been great. Maybe just got a weak batch of sauceSteak: a little too much espresso. The balance between bitter and sweet was a little off but not insultingly so. Just a little too much but that red wine sauce was incredible. Make sure you get some in every bite or it may throw you offDonut bread pudding: perfect. Get it. Not many bread pudding captures the ""pudding "" part. Instead the serve soggy bread and when you to the middle it's just dry. This was tender and sweet to the core. GreatBacon desert: slightly unexpected, however not terrible. The icecream was off the charts good. Wow. The brownie was lame. Served cold and dry. Why not a hot brownie? It was a good brownie but it served room temperature, like it had been sitting for over a day. Like I said it was tastey, but the experience was overall just too dry. No sauce, no warmth, no gooeyness. Id rather take a bowl of icecream with the brownie bits mixed in. Maybe I'm biased towards the flawless bacon ice-cream, but the ratio was off. MORE ICE-CREAM! Haha i don't know, everyone is different but there was too much cold, hard brownie. This is the only dish that needs to actually be re-imagined in my opinion. There was potential in this dessert but the execution of it was no amazing. Tastey! But lacking in cohesion Go here. Enjoy. Stop crying and eat like an adult",5,12/12/2020,Cory H.,1,6,2

Pros : COVID protocol followed. Everyone was seated a safe distance and all staff and cooks wore their mask the entire time. Very well mannered and hard working waitresses and cooks. CONS As a vegan, there is only one menu item that is vegan and that can be considered substantial , there are other vegan items that are there but they are focused on one vegetable . Like Cauliflower, or edamame or broccoli centered dish .. I would love to see more options that included a plant based protein , like chickpeas , tofu , seitan, or mushrooms added since this option will only apply to a niche type of vegan , someone who is not that hungry and going in for a very quick bite to eat. PRO The option are jackfruit tacos which were very well prepared and seasoned. They come in a set of 3 the size of street tacos . Ultimately, it was surprising to see a miniature  selection  of vegan food for a  downtown restaurant. PRO However, they have a great selection of alcoholic drinks that have been crafted to highlight the flavors of the ingredients. I know this restaurant is not targeted at a vegan restaurant but just in case your Omni friends and you are looking for  a night out this is a restaurant   that's can provide good drinks and tasty bites but maybe not a full meal .",3,12/10/2020,Elisabeth O.,0,2,0

Ordered the Schlack's Daiq but he must have misheard and brought out a Tangerine Sour. It was good! Super tart and refreshing. Next we ordered the Schlack's Daiq again and once again had an ingredient that wasn't listed (it's pink! So maybe a berry component?) and it was really good- a great take of a classic daiquiri.

Order anything and you will be happy and in love. Great Bang for the Buck, flavors, vibes, and Covid practices.Walking into Varley felt good, almost as if I had returned home from being away for years. An impossible thought because this was the opening night, but it gives that vibe. The look of this place is incredible! Cozy yet classy, warm but with an edge, simple yet beautiful. I can honestly say that I have not been into a cocktail bar that looked and felt like this. I just want to go back.The staff was perfectly on par. The waitress knew her stuff, she was attentive, helpful, and just happy to be there. I really respected that. If we had a question that she did not know, she would return in seconds with an answer that you would think she took a course at the university on the subject. We had two shareable and two solo dishes. Starting us off was the NC BBQ Pork Rillette. Three fresh, doled up pork sliders that leave you wanting more. The Caroline Vinegar sauce on this alone I want to bottle up and pour into a tub to swim in later. Where did this come from? Wow. The vinegar pared with the Brussel sprouts slaw in a glorious fashion. I would expect every dynamic duo to look at this and give a thumbs up. This is a must-order. The flavor was subtle yet slapping my lips as the little pickled peppers came into play. I could FEEL the taste, something I thought impossible. To complement this sharable, a beautiful bright red Grilled Beet Hummus made its way to the table. For a second I was taken back to the meals they served in Neverland... those bright colored dishes that made you want to reach through the TV and devour. This dish took me there. The bright red color of the beets felt really good on my eyes. I LOVED the beet flavor with the diced cucumbers on top, the whole thing sleeping soundly on a grilled Scallion Roti Bread. Yum. Although this was a starter, I returned to it several times throughout the main course.I ordered the Classic Americana Burger. Two Smashed Beef Patties with traditional fixings. The taste of this bad boy blew my mind. It was not a new taste, just one that I rarely experience in a restaurant, let alone a cocktail bar. I am convinced this burger is now the best-kept secret in Salt Lake City. If you are not familiar with the Maillard reaction, read up on it. A smashed patty is a party where all are invited and all have a part. The flavor is not burned out, the char does not overtake the rest of the experience, each ingredient makes its way to the front stage at just the right moments. I love the bun, not sure what kind it was but it didn't really matter. It contained and had a satisfying crunch, two things that have to be involved with a good burger. In short, this is a rad burger. It comes with a delicious pile of fries that somehow have a first crunch but feel soft. They have nailed the crispy/fresh ratio on these fries. I would imagine that they will have to fight off some pesk that is after their secret formula for the fry sauce. I know there is something else in there besides Mayo and Ketchup... maybe scallions? Garlic? Whatever it is, it is working really well. My lovely girlfriend ordered the Grilled Pear and Goat Cheese Salad with added Grilled Chicken. She usually cannot handle the punch of the goat cheese so she swapped that out with one of the other 2 options they provided. Manchego Cheese. I watched her face as she began the journey. Pure joy. Honestly, PURE JOY. ""I literally have not had a better salad."" They do not mess around when it comes to their salads. Calling it a salad almost demeans it. The grilled chicken was resting on top, almost challenging us to try to eat it all. This is not one of those salads that place a few pieces of the bonus protein on top and calls it good, this is a treasure of ingredients liberally poured on. I had to have what she was having. The Grilled Chicken was juicy, full of flavor, and fresh. SO FRESH. The greens, grilled pears, arugula... So fresh. I kept asking her what kind of dressing was there because it didn't taste like a vinaigrette to me. It has such a sweet, almost sugary flavor on there. I am guessing the Pear-balsamic has something to do with it. Candied Walnuts adding a satisfying crunch, Grilled Pears keep things interesting, you would think they created a new species of salad here that is begging to be had by all. I want to take loved ones here and watch them eat. We had lovely crafted mojito with fresh mint resting on top, I am not a drinker but from the happy and smiling faces around us, they know what they are doing. If the food is this good, surely the cocktails will blow your mind.I wish badly that we had room for dessert, next time.Such a great bang for you buck, 5 out 5, 10 out 10, 20 stars, whatever you want to call it. From the decor to the beautifully built drinks, It's just really really good. I see this becoming a downtown staple, we will be back.",5,10/30/2020,Sam O.,4,7,2

It might just be a Utah thing where it's rare to find to something actually as spicy as advertised, so definitely go with the hot behind to guarantee some spice. I've had hot sandwiches that could pass as medium or below. The hot flavor to me is better, but it's not worth the gamble if you want that spicy experience.

So this go around I went with a medium and it was still really sweet which is just so odd for a ""hot chicken"" sandwich. It felt like it was more breading than meat and once again the chicken was weird and stringy. I had to stop eating it, which sucks because it's not exactly cheap. The fries are whatever, frozen and bland. If they ditched the raggedy Kroger-reject chicken thighs and maybe added tenders or something I'd give them another chance.

The biggest suggestion I have is to give customers an option to make their order a combo. I literally wanted to spend more money, but ordering online doesn't give you the option to add fries and a beverage. It's advertised on their menu to make it a combo, so why not do the same online? It just didn't make sense to get an order of fries because it would be the same cost as a combo essentially.All in all, the sando was satisfying, delicious, and definitely shareable if you wanted to.

The Hearty is what I guess you would consider the main courses of the menu.  The limited one was a bit strange in that it was only two items on it were white a milk stout beer and a Hamachi Tataki plate. Not quite getting that. I guess this is the kind of place where you will need to get multiple dishes to be full.  What that means in disguise is bring your wallet loaded lol.  The drinks menu I thought was a little lacking in terms of selection.  For example, they only had 7 bottled beers on the menu and two of those selections were Negro Modelo 5.4% and Dortmunder Bohemian 6% WTF.  Seems like for an upscale restaurant these are kind of lame choices.  Good news is I found one Rye beer from Salt Flats locally made that worked for me. Wine menu was a little more expansive. What was a bit strange to me was seeing such a large Aperitif drink menu.  Like 30 choices. Granted I don't think I have ever tried one before...  Oh, wait I forgot about my living in Germany days of chasing Jagersnitzel and Rumple Mints with my beers. So, I'm not sure if this is a local thing or not but spending up to $16 dollars for a shot of Digestif seemed a bit crazy but to each their own...I had the Chicories plus Broccolini salad as a starter.  This was presented in a very large bowl so the salad looked tiny... and basically it kind of was.  I'm a salad junky so to say it mildly I would have liked to have a slightly larger portion.  No sharing going to happen here for sure sorry:(  Taste wise the salad had a lot of bitter greens like radicchio chicory etc and the bitter dish was offset with the sweet dates in the mix.  The Sherry vinaigrette gave it a tang.  The Spanish almonds were nice to give it a little crunch.  Think a little avocado would have also been nice but that's just me.  Overall, it was ok but was nothing mind blowing.  For the main dish I had the Bucatini dish which was a pasta dish with a mushroom Bolognese red sauce to go with this.  I came with just a few small pieces of fennel in the dish.  Basically, I was a little underwhelmed with this dish.  I loved the concentrated red sauce and the mushrooms in the dish but it was lacking more pasta.  It was kind of a bummer to have eaten the pasta and have a good portion of mushroom sauce still on the plate.  I mean how much can spaghetti pasta cost to maybe include more so that the whole dish can be enjoyed in totality?  I also didn't really like the spaghetti type pasta for this dish.  The mushrooms and sauce were so concentrated a wider or spiraled type pasta would have made the dish much better. Finally, I got to try a bit of another dish called General Tso's Cauliflower.  This is a vegan dish they offer on the hot menu.  I liked the spicy sauce on this dish a lot but it was a bit over sauced and deep fried.  I think I would have liked it better to have a less oily version that captured the spicy taste of the Tso's maybe adding in some veggies  but that's just me.Overall though I'm glad I got to try this place out and would consider to come back if they offered new veggie related items to try out.  It's a bit spendy as the courses add up but for special occasions I'd say it's worth the dime.",4,1/4/2021,Ron K.,8,8,6

The first time, in late 2018, I had dinner at HSL. That first visit, I was struck by the restaurant's gorgeous ambiance, and the excellent service. I ordered a toast app and the heralded General Tso's Cauliflower along with a cocktail (bourbon-based, I believe, and disappointing), and while the presentation was gorgeous and the food was tasty, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. But, in all fairness, even the chef thought my meal was too carb-heavy. So there is that.And let's just be honest, okay? This is Salt Lake City. It's not LA or New York or SF or any of your other major food cities. So expectations should be tapered a bit. Also, I have found, in my SLC eating expeditions, that Utahns really like salt. In Salt Lake. Haha--get it? But I'm not joking--lots of salt.Anyway, I was in SLC again at the end of January, right before we were widely aware of COVID, for the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit. And I wanted to give HSL another shot. This time, the restaurant was hoppin' (being popular with locals + massive tech summit + Sundance = busy), and even though it took a while to be seated, service was still great. This time I got a gin-based cocktail, which I didn't like much (probably just get wine here), the baby kale salad, and the apple toast.

Absolutely no flavor and just fried batter. Our main course was decent. As my friend who was celebrating her bday went to the restroom we called our waitress over to let her know it was her birthday if she could bring a desert with a candle at the end of dinner. She was extremely loud and kept talking and offering other options as our friend was coming back from the restroom. She brought the cake with the candle while we were still having dinner! Ridiculous. We decided to have a last drink before leaving the table was never cleared to the point that the waitress struggled to find room on the table to set the drinks. Definitely not a great or fun experience.",1,2/27/2021,Teva V.,0,2,1

Well, the two appetizers are incredibly generous in portion size, so we probably would have been fine! We also both got cocktails - a high street Boston sour for me and a house old fashion for my fiancé. First, drinks - I'm personally not big into dark liquor so I knew I wanted a sour. The waitress recommended the high street Bourbon sour, which has rye, egg white, bitters, and lemon in it. It was delightfully citrusy and foamy with the most delicious maraschino cherry on top. On the other hand, my fiancé does enjoy dark liquor so he went with a classic old fashion. His thoughts - ""it was good, just the right amount of orange.""Now, for the food. For the ribs, we went with medium spice. We're living in Texas, so it turns out that medium spice here = no spice. Noted - we'll be sure to order it hotter next time! Otherwise the glaze on the top was sticky and sweet. The poutine was by far my favorite! So savory! Those cheese curds! The perfectly soft boiled egg. Wow. The textures and flavors in this dish were perfect. I would definitely order this one again. Now, the salad was obviously much less savory than the other two dishes. We went with a salad to get some veggies in. I loved the tempura asparagus, and the grape tomatoes added some nice, bright acidity. They are generous with the amount of crab they give you and overall, I felt that the flavors meshed well together.We left feeling fat and happy!

It was delicious and had a simple but elegant presentation. I ordered an equally delicious drink with bourbon and thyme. It was a drink you wanted to sip and savor (and believe me, I did!). Having just had drinks at Fletcher's in Park City and been disappointed by both the enormous price tag for a subpar drink, I was pleasantly surprised that Whiskey Street offers supremely high quality cocktails for $8-18 (I think mine was only $10-12).I had the pasta bolognese special and a side caesar. GET THE CAESAR SALAD. Oh my god, it is fantastic! I cannot stress this enough. The side comes as a small head of perfectly grilled romaine with a thick and flavorful dressing drizzled over it. The presentation was stunning and the woody/charred flavor unmatched. The pasta was just okay. It lacked the meaty crumbles I expected to find in a bolognese, and the noodles were very stiff (reminded me of very thick ramen and undercooked ramen).My partner had the Bourbon Salmon.

Whiskey Street is conveniently located on Main Street alongside many other bars. As long as you're there, you won't miss the outdoor patio and the somewhat rustic look. I will say, this isn't my go to since my friends and I would rather have a casual vibe than overpay for food and drinks. The price is quite the turnoff, not just for the drinks. Why overpay for basic sandwiches when you can go next door to Ramen Bar for a very reasonably priced, delicious bowl of ramen. Even drinks here are mediocre for the price. For a few bucks extra, I'd rather go to Lake Effect for its ambiance and better selection of alcohol. Even the Rest next door has a much more fun environment, which I'd recommend any day.

Now that sounds ratchet, but it is a fancy saloon feel, like a sophisticated saloon. I had been here before Covid-19 and I have just visited recently during this Covid-19 pandemic. Overall look at their precautionary measures: masks to enter, hand sanitizer at the door, distanced seating, and the servers are always wearing a mask as well. The service has always been decent. My most recent experience was just a couple days ago. I went with my boyfriend, Stanley, and we had originally planned on going to White Horse, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we decided to go next door, and we were not disappointed. We were seated immediately at a table across from the bar, all of the booths were sadly taken. The waitress was a delight! She was so kind and took time to reassure us on our choice of food.We ordered the NY Steak Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette and the Cajun Shrimp Pasta. They were both so delicious! It was a good mix of food. The Cajun Shrimp Pasta is on the heavier, thicker side and the salad was light and refreshing. In short, the Cajun Shrimp Pasta was like thick, short ramen noodles marinated in a creamy orange sauce with shrimp and sausage. The NY Steak Salad was like any other salad, but what made it the better dish for me was the steak. The greens were served with a fully cooked steak on top of the salad, which gave it a more refined look. The steak, oh my gosh, was juicy and thick. We had it cooked to medium and it was still quite red, which actually usually bothers me, but I took a bite of this steak before having it sent back and it did not taste bloody at all! It was one of the best steaks I had eaten in a while. The only thing my boyfriend mentioned was that maybe if it was a bit warmer, it would have been even better, but overall it was DELICIOUS!The one thing I would take away from my review is the food. The NY Steak Salad is one of the cheaper options on the mention, clocking in at $16 for the entree, but I think it is one of the best options on the menu!",4,7/12/2020,Christine M.,0,2,0

I also really enjoyed the roasted nan bread that accompanied the roasted beet hummus and mussels. Extra kuddos * my Palestinian girl friend really appreciated the use of the word and the spice ""za'atar"" utilized in the roasted beet hummus. Which is not something that she sees often in SLC.

I went with a couple girlfriends, one of whom had recommended this new spot. We were super eager to go for cocktails. I was initially put off when the man checking ID's at the front (I believe the owner) didn't believe my ID was real. I'm older than 21 and recently moved from Florida, but he side-eyed me pretty hard, even after he scanned it and it went thru. I found the cocktails to be a bit pricey, but hey, we're downtown and it was a special occasion for us, so no worries. The waitress brought us a round of cocktails and forgot my friend's drink. Hey, people forget, no worries. But it took about fifteen, almost twenty minutes for her drink to come. We obviously waited to cheers, but by the time her drink arrived, mine was getting warm. Lame. The waitress really should have made that forgotten drink the priority, rather than taking orders at other tables.We finished the first round and went to order a second round and the waitress let us know that The Ivy is a restaurant, not bar, so we'd need to order food as well. To my understanding, that's actually not legal in Utah - being that they are a restaurant, we would have had to order our food first, along with the first round of drinks. The waitress gave us the option of a ""Chex mix"" type of snack, which we decided to go for since we weren't too hungry. Y'all. I tried to stifle my laughter when she brought the ""Chex Mix"". It was less than a 1/4 cup size - for the table! I counted seven tiny pretzels! C'mon. The waitress probably should have brought one for each of us, it was hilariously tiny. Like, we're really supposed to divy up those pretzels? We obviously weren't aware of the size, but she should have had better judgment there.I ordered my drink of choice, a g+t with a local gin, Beehive I believe. My drink came out and it was...pink? I've never in my life ordered a plain gin and tonic and it was pink. I checked with the waitress to make sure she had brought me the correct drink, she assured me it was. It was tasty, but I couldn't taste a hint of gin or alcohol in it. Super lame. Now, I'm 5'8"", 155 lb. lady here who hadn't eaten since lunch, only Chex Mix in my belly, it's now 8pm and I'm on my 3rd g+t and not even a buzz? What's up with that? It honestly felt like a joke. Like I was being tricked. I had gone to another restaurant earlier that week and had a solid buzz from two g+t's made with the same gin. Bartender here was definitely diluting the drink! And for the price, that's just not cool. We were at the restaurant for about 1.5 hours in total, drinking and laughing as we ladies do on a ladies night out. The waitress brought out the check a little earlier than we would have liked, which was okay until she came back yet again to say, pretty firmly, ""goodnight"". Minutes later, a different waitress came by to say ""goodnight"". Obviously, we were being hustled out. The hours are until midnight, and it was only 9:30! The place was emptying out, but seriously? And it isn't like we weren't an expensive table - we spent around $200 in drinks total (which is sort of crazy, since we each had 2 drinks except 3 for me). The waitress definitely made good tips from us (I never leave less than 20% and usually round up to 22-25% especially because with COVID these are hard times for our service staff), so I couldn't understand why we were being hustled out!This review is long, and I certainly don't mean to be rude, I just wanted to give the details. The entire vibe since we arrived was that we just weren't wanted there. That's not a cool feeling, you guys! We were really excited to try the place out and it felt like there was virtually no alcohol in my drinks and the waitress was pretty rude.

I could believe it and I know you know what I'm taco-ing about.

Food was a bit slow but I expect that to accelerate as they get systems dialed in. Waiting for my takeout order, I had the apps at least 20 minutes before anything else, but they (unnecessarily) apologized - and, as I said, I'm confident they'll have it dialed in soon. The upside: time to write most of this review. Interior is narrow and deep - maybe a dozen tables, so we got ours to go (hey, still better to be safe in the pandemic times). Decor is industrial and multicultural, reflecting the menu. And if you don't like your music thumpin' you don't want to dine in. (Might be worth dialing in the EQ; at least from the front it's all bass and hi-hat.)The menu itself is wide ranging and definitely not afraid to branch out from the sacred taco form. And please go read the names of the kids menu items. They're classic. Neighbor Diabolical Records (also five stars even if I haven't reviewed it yet) recommends everything so I felt comfortable on the first order. Appetizers/sides were high on our list to try, including chips + guacamole (chips included in guacamole even if it's not obvious on printed menu) and elotes. Both were fantastic, and the chips are light and taste housemade (I prefer the lighter kind, so if the thick are your preference (1) order these anyway and (2) you're misguided.)Back to the taco menu: we ordered only half-ish of it to start. Every single one is recommended. Chancho: sweet and tender; the onion is a great balance. Uncle Al: after one bite, my wife exclaimed ""that's the best taco in America."" It might be. Note: the made from scratch tortillas are exceptional. Jimmy Churri: tender meat, cheese-encrusted tortilla and fresh chimichurri sauce. Possibly my most favorite of six favorites. Rude Bull: quality steak and probably the best asada I have had in years. Spice as a a delightfully delayed fuse. Amy Hates Fish: zesty and citrus-y and definitely not fishy. Lebanese Blonde: since ""juusto"" is Finnish for ""cheese,"" I felt we needed to try the grilled ""cheese cheese.""  A Mediterranean-tasting vegetarian winner. On our return I think I'll try a few tortillas ala carte so I can try the ones made with less obvious ingredients - and of course the Tikka and K-Pop.

I wonder if it's simply a reflection of the struggles during COVID given how much other people seem to like it. But for us, it was awful across the board.  Service- Our main server seemed to be there against his will. I half expected him to say ""I am being treated well and am unharmed.""- One of the guys helping him bring the food stood directly over me as he walked through the dishes. Having a dude in your space and breathing over your food like that is just gross even before you factor in COVID.- For some reason they make the server read off like 613 specials. You couldn't tell where one ended and the next one began.- We had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation. That's a lot.Food- Bruschetta. It was ... fine? You've had better, but it's inoffensive.- Pasta sampler for one. Like the bruschetta, it wasn't terrible. But very one note (oil & fractionally overcooked pasta).- App trio (beef carpaccio, shrimp, crab). This was the first affirmatively bad dish. The beef was all salt and oil and tasted like it had been sitting around a day too long. The seafood dishes similarly were not fresh.- Veal in some kind of oily caper sauce. Oil on oil on oil.- Two of us ordered the fish trio. Fish was slightly overcooked, and smothered in sauces that were fairly muddy tasting, and had a bit of a ""this has been sitting out waaaay too long"" to them.Price: somehow all of that and a $70 bottle of wine topped $350 prior to tip. That's insane. And, honestly, I'm kicking myself for not looking carefully at the bill because it's not clear to me how the math even gets close to that in the cold light of the next day.One random note.

I agree with the previous reviewer, what's going on with Valter's? We've eaten at Valter's four times over the last year and each time we had a good experience. I recently tried to make reservations for dinner. I left three voicemails over a three day period. No one returned my call. I called again and finally reached someone on the phone and made a reservation for a Friday night two weeks out. Great. Five minutes later I received a call back from Valter's indicating that they could not accommodate me (without explanation) for the time that they previously committed to. I was told they were not taking reservations between the hours of 6:15-7:30 pm. I'm not sure if they were saving this timeframe for walk-ins? Needless to say I was not pleased with them canceling the reservation immediately after accepting it. They offered seating either very early or much later but neither were convenient for our plans that evening. I told them about the issue of having three voicemails earlier in the week that were not returned. They blamed it on the ""high winds"" earlier this week. I'm not sure how that would affect their phones, but okay, I'll give them a pass. One would have thought, given their mistake, that they would have honored their commitment. Not only were we looking forward to a good dinner at Valter's, we also wanted to support local restaurants who have suffered loss of revenue during C19. I'm not sure the reason why Valter's has become so disorganized that  they can't return phone calls, make (and keep) a simple reservation, or provide basic customer service after they've failed to provide it (multiple times).

They made sure our glasses were always full and our bread basket was never empty. Two of us ordered the ""taste of Tuscany"" tasting menu, and I ordered the above dish.I was fine up until I finished about 1/3 of my entree. I started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded and was sweating. My stomach felt funny and gassy. It all hit me very quickly. I had to close my eyes and rest my head on my hands. Apparently my friends asked if I was feeling ok, but I couldn't respond for a couple of minutes. Finally, I threw up (at the dinner table, very sorry about that), but it just involuntarily happened and next thing I knew I just could not stop. They were kind and helped. They initially gave me a bucket (you know, the dirty red sanitizer buckets you see restaurants use to hold bleach water that wipes tables at the end of a meal), to throw up into (rather than a clean bag??). I cut dinner short because I felt horrible. One of us stayed behind to pay the bill. Two of us only ate up to the mains of the tasting menu. The receipt still showed full bill WITH the seafood pasta. They didn't offer to remove the item that made me sick or even an appetizer. We paid it.Their response to our claim (that it was food poisoning) even after we paid for it, was what ultimately made me give them 1 instead of 2 stars. When they called us later that night to check up, we said that we think it's food poisoning from their seafood as I've eaten most of the seafood, and all three of us ate the same foods all day except for food in the restaurant. They denied it, claiming their seafood is ""fresh"" and the muscles are ""frozen"" so it can not have gone bad or have bacteria. Worse yet, we're insistent it's NOT their food quality issue, but something else I ate before dinner.The three of us are the same food all day except for different mains for dinner so I don't see how I could've caught the bug from different food. Everyone else was fine that night. Don't think I need to explain further what happened at home. Also, I shared a couple of muscles with one of the people in the party. The next day, he also felt a bit unwell and had to use the bathroom. Nice things about them: their complementary bruschetta and artichoke gravy for their bread were delicious.

It was breaded pork, covered in a chunky tomato sauce and mozzarella. The ravioli 4 formaggi, fettuccine with chicken and shrimp were also super tasty.

We arrived a couple mins before our reservation and they seated us ten mins after our reservation. Even though it was a Monday, the place was PACKED. We were served complimentary brucetta and break with a sauce. The bread was PERFECT, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The majority of the group ordered on entree while others ordered two. Because two people ordered an extra dish, it meant our food took even longer to come out. It was pretty awkward sitting around watching them eat then waiting even longer to get our orders. I got the fettuccini with a four cheese gorgonzola sauce. It tasted like a fancy Alfredo with a hint of Gorgonzola. (Was it worth $30 + tax and tip...I'm still debating). The portions were average size, everyone finished all the food on their plates and didn't need take away bags. The best part (aside from spending time with friends) was the dessert. They give you a complimentary hot chocolate and lemon biscotti. It was AMAZING. The bad part of this was the meal took forever.

From the moment we walked in we knew we were in for a treat. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and we were greeted by Valter himself. After being seated we were brought complementary bruschetta which had an incredible lightness and finesse to it that we were not expecting. We were also brought bread for the table. The bread was definitely made in house. It was soft and warm and was served with an olive oil with garlic and capers in it. The saltiness of the capers was perfect with the oil and the garlic. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and recommended a few things for our entree and recommended an Italian fruit drink (which I cannot remember the name of but it was amazing.) My husband ordered the lasagna and I ordered the gnocchi. My husband is of Italian heritage and we are VERY picky about Italian food. My husbands lasagna was perfectly balanced. He ate up every bite and raved about it the entire time. My gnocchi was absolutely perfect. Many places put too much flour in them making them dense and weighted down. Not Valter's. The gnocchi were perfect light, and fluffy pillows covered with just the right amount of zesty tomato sauce. After tasting one I looked at my husband and literally said ""I have just died and gone to food heaven."" They were that good. After we finished our entrees we ordered some dessert but were also given a small cup of melted Italian chocolate and a biscotti  to dip in the chocolate. The chocolate was rich and warm and I wanted to drink the whole cup (which I slightly regret not doing) and the biscotti was the perfect texture. For dessert my husband ordered the panna cotta and I ordered the tiramisu. I didn't get a chance to taste my husbands dessert but he said it was perfectly balanced and the texture was spot on. My tiramisu was also perfect. The balance of coffee to cream was exactly how it is supposed to be. We loved everything we ate here and I believe what makes this place so incredible and different is Valter. He greets everyone and roams around the restaurant making sure everyone is comfortable and having a good time while also visiting the kitchen. Yes, the prices are high but it is definitely worth it.

But when trying to take our order, she seemed to get flustered ?? I ordered something about 5 times but she seemed to have missed it, so when I told her I wanted to include that as part of my meal when she repeated our order, she was not havin it. Need I remind you, I repeated myself multiple times so like... you chose not to listen. No one else was talking either, so it's not like it was loud. However, I apologized anyway for the confusion on behalf of our table and she was like ""yeah y'all should've written it out, that would've been helpful"" with some sass. Mmm excuse me ma'am okay, it is 8 am on a Sunday not sure if you were getting over a hangover but I'm from out of town and did not choose violence that day.. so I kept my mouth shut. Our food comes out - they are starting to place it on our table and we are trying to make additional space and while a different lady was holding the plates, she made a snarky comment about us needing to hurry up because the plates were hot. Okay yes, totally get it - the plates are hot and you want to set it down, however, your tone was not appreciated and I did not need to get sassed for the second time that morning. Like there was a different way to deliver that message and that was not it. Not only was her tone rude but so was her comment.. I wish I could've remembered what it was.Then, our bill comes out. We already know the staff is not a fan of our table so we didn't even bother asking for a split check - so one person paid and pressed a print button on the portable device they gave us - cause you know.. we assumed it would print the receipt after we paid. However, we did not know it printed to the kitchen.. I mean it really was an accident, like you insert your card and a screen pops up asking to print, one would assume it's the receipt of the bill! Well the waitress came up to us and we were like hey we tried printing the bill but didn't see it come out, so was wondering if you could print it for us. And again with the sass and condescending tone - ""it printed to the kitchen so unless you want them to make your food again you shouldn't have pressed that"" I'M SORRY MAAM WHO PUT B-WORD IN YOUR CEREAL THIS MORNING?

The people who work here are super sweet and make you feel welcome. But the FOOD?! Lawd Jesus. Delicious! I got the Benedict biscuit and every bite of that was delicious. Biscuit was soft, egg perfectly cooked, savory yet slightly sweet ham...yummmm. I could eat this at least once a week and look forward to it every time as if it was my first, every time. I washed that down with an OJ mimosa. The juice was freshly squeezed! It was so delicious and refreshing. And if you appreciate hot sauce that is spicier than Cholula, you have GOT to sprinkle the red and green sauces available at the table. The red has a pretty strong punch so sprinkle with caution-or not, all up to you. The green tasted fresh, like my mom makes back in LA.

She made the perfect recommendation of the Parrillada for us to share, and everything on it was SO GOOD. Chicken, shrimp, and steak, plus quesadillas, soup (not my favorite), and extra tortillas. The guacamole was amazing. The chips were just OK--nothing special, but no complaints.

I was so excited to eat here. What a disappointment on many levels. First. It was Cinco De Mayo, so I expected the wait to be long. Which was completely fine. Waited 20 min outside. The lady came out and called my name, even when I had a buzzer. Was confused. She said she could seat us, but it's another long wait, because they had accepted 50 online orders. Well okay then. That's fine. Sat down. Was seated in the back. There are carboard boxes left out. Reminded me of a storage area. Drinks were okay. Ordered a few shots of Patron and the mango tango. The mango tango was good. The tequila shots were served in shot glasses that look really old and dirty. They were hardly dressed, and with a few salt rocks, and a dry lime.  Chips & salsa were terrible. Broken pieces of chips served in a basket with a small dish of salsa. Appetizer was good! Toritos yellow peppers stuffed with jack cheese and shrimp. I won't be coming back, so this was the best thing. Waited and waited and waited for our dinner. It appeared they completely forgot about us. We had to ask for drink refills. Well actually get up and find someone. Or tap on the waitresses shoulder at a table next to us. Everyone who arrived after us had already eaten at this point. Asked where our food was. Then finally brought it to us. Got the chicken and cheese enchilada smothered with mole sauce. I got both the poblano and verde mole. Both were runny. Not really flavorful. My friend got the chimichanga. It could have been a frozen one microwaved. That's exactly what it tasted like. The kicker.....The lady from  Chanel 5 news happen to be sitting across from us. She was treated like royalty. Drinks brought out before she could even ask. Her appetizer was served in 20 seconds. Constant waiters and waitresses at her table ready to provide the best customer service, while we sat across from her and was completely forgotten about.

VERY light on sauce and just not flavorful. Our order took about an hour to come out so I'm sure the spaghetti was ready early and they were waiting on the other entrées.  The ribeye, ordered by another member of our party ""was delicious"" he reported, and I ordered the short ribs, served in a sauce or ""soup""  that was hot and flavorful and I really enjoyed them.Don't expect a cool vibe or anything like that... featured in the entry is a large coke cooler with the associated bright red- back lit logo on it and make sure to dress warm... it's very cold if they sit you anywhere by the entry. The place was busy, not overly crowded and everyone seemed to be having a good time.

Oquirrh,"[{'alias': 'newamerican', 'title': 'American (New)'}]",4.5,"{'latitude': 40.767193, 'longitude': -111.880359}",['delivery'],$$$,False,"Oquirrh, a long-time resident on my list of desired restaurants without my ever managing a visit, demanded I attempt the unthinkable: dine out alone! For many, this is commonplace, and I enjoy doing most things by myself, so cannot say why this hadn't occurred prior, but regardless, I was a lone diner virgin here. And I felt kind of weird about it. I made a reservation for noon on a Saturday, though on arrival, found this to be unnecessary, with only two other parties present. There was plenty of parking out front along the street, but I could see it being inadequate at dinnertime. Oquirrh is in a small, charming brick building, and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. Given the choice of a dining room or bar seat, I chose the former, and made myself snug in a corner. It is a cozy space, with large front windows, beautiful artwork adorning the walls, and a modern, attractive bar. I need not have worried as, with a book to keep me company, I did not feel lonely or awkward at all!Brunch is available on Saturdays and Sundays (dinner daily except when they are closed Monday and Tuesday (and Sundays are 20% off for industry night!). The menu was limited to ten items, with a couple sides, but I do not mind this, as I would much prefer fewer, but better options. The beverage menu is extensive, though, featuring several cocktails and beers, a variety of wines, and even some fun, less common non-alcoholic options. Three desserts were also available.It seems there is sometimes a daily special as I was informed there was not one on my visit, but the scramble/omelet consists of a seasonal and varying selection of ingredients, on this day, roasted sunchokes, rapini, and parmesan. At first, I leant toward the salad or carrots (though sweet or savory funnel cake is very intriguing!), but that seemed too boring, plus I'd heard rave reviews of the hash browns. With this in mind, I opted for the omelet with soft shell crab added 'cause I'm living my best life and you've got to take advantage when that beloved crustacean is on offer! My order took only ten or so minutes to arrive, presented beautifully on a heavy stoneware platter. Now, to me, a well and skillfully made omelet is luscious, creamy, and...ahem, moist. While I would not go so far as to call this one dry, it was browned in spots, and decidedly not the epitome of omelet perfection. I adored the well-prepared sunchokes and rapini, the crab legs were fantastic and crunchy, but I found the breading to have softened too much by the time I got to its body. The hash browns were everything promised: crispity crunchy exterior, an inch thick, rich and velvety tender inside. Offered ketchup or hot sauce, I took the latter, and would suggest you do the same! It imparted the perfect amount of heat, acid, and peppery flavor without overwhelming any component of my dish. My server was one of the owners, and wife of the chef. She was lovely and friendly, chatting amiably with others dining in, and even taking a seat next to me as I made payment, to share their restaurant philosophy. The problem, I think, is my oft-made complaint that New American feels slightly uninspired, in part due to my ability to create similar dishes at home. And while quick to point out they feel no desire to label themselves as that (or any) particular style of cuisine, it is what they are serving here. They also eschew the title of fine dining, and I agree they are not quite there (in the best way! The vibe is much more relaxed and pleasant). With that said, prices averaging $20-$30+ an entrée convey the expectation of a certain level of excellence, and especially for such simple fare as an omelet, I was a little disappointed.

The second two visits would suggest as much.On our first trip to Oquirrh, in early June, we were preoccupied by the delighted anticipation of an upcoming trip to the inimitable Chez Panisse just a few weeks later. With this in mind, we were expecting a pleasant, but unremarkable dining experience at Oquirrh, one that we felt we should have before it would inevitably shutter its doors, like so many unremarkable SLC fine dining establishments. However, as our server attended to us, impeccably timing one stellar cocktail and appetizer after the next, we began to wonder: If this is real, and it's always like this, then why do we need to spend $600 for dinner at Chez Panisse. Cocktails were creative, but balanced. A consummate professional, our server served the meal with impeccable timing, was attentive, warm, engaged, contained, and not the slightest smidge invasive. The black radishes were cold and fresh, butter rich and tangy, and sourdough bread had the perfect crumb and tooth. As we noshed on the salad, bavette steak and tartare, we kept looking each other with delighted alarm. What is going on here? Again, why bother with Chez Panisse when Oquirrh is practically in our back yard?Alas. On two other occasions we again dined at Oquirrh, first expecting another sublime dining event, and on the second, just hoping things might turn around. Service was slow, sloppy, and casual. A different server, but the same for visits two and three. Well into our second cocktail, she casually noted that she had forgotten to bring us water, despite us having requested it upon being seated. She got around to it, eventually. We waited, and waited, and waited further for each stage of the meal. And then, she brought out the appetizer, the previously glorious sourdough, WITH the entrees, which by then, was cold and mostly too crunchy to eat. Tragic. Also, she kept calling me ""hon."" Look, if you work at Sapp Brothers, which is a fabulous local truckstop diner, please, feel free to call me ""hon."" Though the servers at Sapp Brothers are expert at intuiting when to lay down such casual language, and when to be more formal. This server could take some lessons from those splendid hash-slingers. The food on round two was mostly unremarkable, except for the root vegetable terrine, which was a delicate stack of improbably shaved and perfectly sous vided goodness. Round three food, excluding the bread, was solid. We tried the kale stem risotto and the pasta with lobster. Delish. Both were a joy to consume, and they made me want to cook. To be fair, Oquirrh was packed on visits two and three, so perhaps this is a problem with management rather than service. Still, a good restaurant can handle busy, and no fine dining patron should ever be addressed as ""hon.""

We ordered the sourdough which came out burnt and had a terribly lack luster butter on the side. The carrots were small, and unevenly salted. The potatoes were the best appetizer we tried, but not enough for a table of four. As a vegetarian my menu choices were limited, so I went with the barley berry risotto. It tasted like a berry dessert cobbler. It was incredibly sweet for a main dish. When the waitress asked why I had not completed my meal, I told her so. She said she would check with the kitchen because that was an unusual critique of the meal. When she returned her response to me was, ""The kitchen is going to make a new batch and make sure it is up to par."" A new batch for who? So if the kitchen remakes and tastes the risotto and says they like it, then my opinion and the opinion of the diners I was with did not matter? She asked ME about the meal, I did not complain or send it back. Very odd response. Wine selection was not great and the cocktails were medi-Oquirrrrrrrrrrh.

Later that night we had gone out to HSL, a restaurant that Yelp suggested was going to be awesome. As it turned out the three of us decided HSL was not awesome... so much so that we decided to leave after only having drinks and appetizers. After leaving we started to talk about the pizza that we had for lunch. We all decided we should actually go to Diversion to try the pizza again and see what it was like fresh out of the oven. Not only was it incredible but all three of us were able to have food and drink for the price of one entree at HSL which I believe is overrated.

It is more enjoyable when you go into a place like Diversion where the owner greets you at the table, and the staff doesn't act like they are so posh.

At first I thought it was more of a sit down order type restaurant which it was not. You w Ent up to the front and  ordered you ur food and drinks. I ordered the steak fries putine which was absolutely amazing!!! The steak was super tender cooked to perfection. The gravy they used was spot on and the egg was icing on the cake! The food came out super fast. Customer services was really great. Now the down falls... we went when they had a band playing which was cool and all but there was no room for conversation with the peers I was with. We literally were yelling at each other when we were trying to talk. Another thing that actually bugged all of us is they had the option to order Champagne for Mimosas. Usually at other brunch spots a bottle of Champaign is usually $13-$15 for a bottle that also comes with juice of your choice. Well here a bottle of champagne was $20 and on top of that it didn't come with juice... like you had to order and pay for the juice which a surprise to the whole table. My advise for this place is if someone is going to buy a $20 of champagne for mimosas... include the juice. Don't charge them extra for it. Also it was a small glass of juice. Unless you want to ratio of your mimosa 90% champagne and 10% juice, you're going to run out of juice after making 3-4 mimosas and then will have to order more juice. All in all 3 out of 5 stars.

I wasn't sure about the premise. I mean, aren't all restaurants social places to hang out? But now that I've been here finally I think I get it. I think what they were going for is a place where people of all ages are free to hang out with their friends and family. There are a lot of places in Utah that people hang out at but most of these places are bars and because of Utah's strict laws, you can't bring your kids or your friends who are underage. Even though this place is all ages, they have a huge selection of alcohol and even sell shots! I like the chill atmosphere and the wait staff are very attentive (almost too attentive!). They also have a huge selection of non boozy drinks and even have kombucha on tap!The menu is a little overwhelming, I think they're trying too hard to please everyone with it but the good news is that if you have any dietary restriction, they are likely able to accommodate you. I also feel like the name is a little too literal and is a little bit of a turn off. I mean, in it's attempt to be extremely descriptive, it's actually not descriptive of the kind of food you can expect. The kind of food they serve is similar to a regular burger place but with a million options of how to serve it to accommodate various dietary restrictions. If you don't have any dietary restrictions, you'll probably be happy just ordering the daily special or a plain burger. I ended up ordering the plain burger but substituting for dairy free cheese (because dairy doesn't agree with me), and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of everything!This is a great place to go to if you are with a large group of people and everyone wants something different and are different ages and what not.

We need more places like this. It has been on my list to try after I discovered what it was. I would drive by regularly squinting to try to read their sign from the street. After some Yelp detective work I discovered that it was indeed a new eatery of sorts which is a novel idea for this particular area. Last Saturday night we decided it was time to give it a try after being dejected by multiple over-crowded restaurants downtown. We showed up just a little bit after 8PM. Besides us there were a group of three gentlemen at the bar glued to some college hoops on TV. There was Jazz game and UFC fights that were also happening at that moment. This is definitely not a fight venue, but the staff was happy to oblige changing one of the channels to the Jazz while we waited. The staff was boisterously outgoing and helpful. They were kind enough to run us through the menu offering multiple suggestions after discovering it was our first visit. The burger bowls didn't seem very appealing to me so I went with the Old Timer minus red onions. My date tried the Aloha pizza. We also ordered chips and salsa with guac. My date wanted to try the sweet potato fries. However, they decided to include those with my burger instead of the fries I ordered which was a bit of a disappointment for me. Also our chips came with just the guac and no salsa, but this was easily overlooked as the guac was super delish.  Their beer selection was slightly better than average focusing mainly on Salt Flats brews. We decided to get our order to go as we had enough fun for that particular evening. We waited about 20 mins as our selections were crafted exclusively to order. While we waited a couple DoorDashers came in, but that is about it, sadly. The ambiance is obviously centered around socializing. There are cool talking points hanging on all the walls and there are social games that you can play with groups. Excellent concept. If this place were around a few years ago when I was in my 20s we would have hung out here all the time waiting for the clubs to open. They close at 10PM otherwise it would have been the perfect after hours spot. My burger ended up being pretty good. My date was a little underwhelmed by the pizza and the sweet potato fries were too cold and soggy by the time we got them home.Our chips n guac, pizza, and burger came to just under $25 so the price is definitely reasonable.

Design is modern. Staff overly friendly. Main issue was value prop of the food.For the price, the food leaves a bit to be desired. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I thought I ordered safe by picking two things from the daily specials (usually daily specials are popular items designed to make repeat customers, even if it is only once a week).I tried the pizza(Monday special) and the wings (Wednesday special). Again, for the prices I've had better food experiences. I did like the water.From the gist of things I'm thinking that the burger bowls are their main thing, but I didn't even see one on the daily specials.I really hope they improve with time. I will probably go back sometime to give it another shot for two reasons:  1) it's right next to a Quench It (my fave soda place) 2) I really want to see their success.More detail on the food.Pizza: I'm pretty easy going. I need to be wowed by at least one of the key pizza elements, dough, sauce, toppings. I thought all 3 were just ok.Wings: I'm picky. There's not a lot to wings, the wing itself and the flavor enhancer i.e sauce or rub. The wing must be perfect. I thought the wing was too soft, maybe even soggy. It looked very satisfying, but biting into it wasn't as satisfying. I don't think the wing would be any good eaten by itself, which this is the most telling attribute. The flavor enhancer was good, I got the jalepeño rub.",2,12/23/2019,Gregory H.,0,1,0

For full disclosure, I attended a yelp elite event a Diversion and will let the 40 other people wax on about the all the normal things. Diversion is attempting produce a modern public house; a meeting place intended for casual food, drink and socialization..... and yes, that is different than a bar. The public house is more of a European tradition and akin to the brauhaus of German. While competition from places like Beer Bar, Fischer, and The Garage place a strong emphasis on the over priced alcohol gut busting meals, Diversion has aimed for a moderately priced evening that is fit for a number of social situations. This is a great place of your tinder date... or any first date... because it is moderate priced, has food and drink options, has games, and is purposely geared towards breaking the ice. I wouldn't be ashamed to bring people here from work for networking or the first stop on an all night bender. It is a great option for college students(if they are old enough) that want a group meeting away from campus and aren't interested in that greasy spoon on the west side of campus with walls covered with pictures of people nobody remembers or cares about. Quick note on food - it's good! Buns make the burger. Poutine... yup. Pizza is heavy on toppings and the crust is a bit thin for that. For this location, I would use a thick crust to make sure nobody leaves wanting.Quick note on booze - it's good! They have their own pilsner. It's unremarkable and very much a pilsner. The kind of beer that pairs well with most any food and won't make you smell like a brewery.The location is close enough to the city for biking and near a freeway entrance for people that own a home. There is off street parking.And finally, the complaints: The exterior sign is impossible to see at night. The interior has signs with cute ice breakers, but they are on clear plastic and difficult to read with my sniper eyes. So why 4 stars, because i'm going to hold out the last star for a return visit.... And that should say something about the level of interest. Cheers.",4,11/19/2019,Jay M.,2,5,1

I'm pretty sure the cold weather and snow had something to do with it. Anyway, what better way to warm your soul with some delicious and spicy Thai boat noodles?Kin Sen doesn't put blood in their boat noodles, if that makes or breaks anyone's decision. Blood certainly adds a layer of flavor to the broth, but I really don't have a preference either way. Regardless, the broth smelled fragrant and inviting. It was sweet and very comforting to sip and drink. We ordered it as spicy as possible, which definitely has a kick. Careful when drinking it otherwise you'll end up coughing up a lung like my fiancee.They did not skimp on the fixings like beef, gai lan, and meatballs. Initially I wished the portion was bigger, but throughout our meal, I realized that it was actually a pretty big portion because we were getting pretty full from just sharing it.Sad to say, the noodles were broken into bits and pieces... which also is kind of a pet peeve of mine. If the noodles were actual strands and al dente, it would've been more enjoyable.I've had much better boat noodles elsewhere, but Kin Sen makes theirs pretty good. I'm sure this is probably the best you'll find in SLC or Utah for that matter.Kin Sen Noodle Bar is definitely a one-stop shop for noodles. There's noodle soups, pan fried noodles, and even several rice dishes too. They have crowd favorites like ramen, pho, pad thai, and different renditions of pasta with Asian flavors/ingredients. There's sure to be something for everyone, no matter what kind of nood mood you're in.",4,1/8/2021,Kurtis C.,0,1,0

The soup was a perfect blend of red curry and coconut milk (arguably the best dairy out there), and the toppings were a lovely mix of savory and crunchy.

I can't comment on the atmosphere because we had it delivered in these COVID times, but I can say that the food was still hot when it came.

We were brought a meager amount of bread (maybe a slice divided into 4 tiny pieces) that was cold and relatively stale. 50 minutes later out server finally took our appetizer and dinner orders.

When the main entrees actually arrived (an hour and a half after we were seated) it was really mediocre, with my ""spicy"" gnocchi being absolutely foul and the sauce straight out of a can, and the ravioli overcooked and sad looking, served off a rickety table with a used dish towel near my food, not to mention the server removing his mask several times to talk to us and other tables.

The salad was simple yet delicious.  For the second course, I had the gnocchi arrabbiata and my partner had the ravioli with ricotta and spinach. From the first bite you knew that the pasta was made in-house; it was perfect.  Both dishes were properly sauced, had just the right amount of heat and perfectly al dente.  We both wanted seconds.Our waitress recommended a lovely bottle of Chianti to go with our dinner; and it was perfect selection.For our entrees, I had the veal saltimbocca and J had the lamb; although good they were just too salty and after a few bites we couldn't finish.  The manager came over and saw our plates and asked if everything was okay; we mentioned that it was slightly salty.  He immediately whisked them away and had them remade for us.  This is service.  The dessert was a nice ending to a well rounded meal.  Once again, the evening was all about the service.  Our waitress was fun, she was lively and engaging.  She had such a playful personality and she made our evening.  The manager, walked the restaurant and was so attentive to his guests.  You could tell he took absolute pride in his job and restaurant and it showed.We weren't able to finish our bottle of wine; so we gave what was left to our lovely waitress so she could enjoy it with her Valentine after her shift was over.We will definitely be back on our next trip to SLC.For a fun read, please read my review on Bambara.",4,2/23/2020,Linda K.,0,0,0

Here goes.Decor.  Done nicely with a semi converted garage or industrial space, the tables are appropriately spaced apart, the overall look is simple, elegant but with modern industrial overtones making it a 'very nice' looking space.Service.  Quite good.  Our staff was nice, not super knowledgeable but competent and food prep and food running was efficient and satisfying.Food.  Average at best.  While there was absolutely nothing wrong with the food, there was zero memorable or technically delicious about any of the meals for our table of four.  Lasagna portions are small but ok, Halibut was the fish of the day (I have a rule of never ordering seafood in a land-locked state but on our us did order it and said plainly it was 'fine', not as in fine food, but just ok).  Caesar salads were ordinary and nothing to speak of, and the cheeses used were rather bland.  But the really odd thing were the drinks.  Now I know this is Salt Lake City and there's a lot of odd rules about alcohol in the state, but I had 4 (four) martinis and didn't get a buzz.  Yes FOUR OF THEM.  If I had had four martinis in a restaurant in New York, or LA, or Miami, I would have been smashed.  Of course, they cost the same as in New York, or LA, or Miami, but all of us walked out of the place not feeling a thing.  Watered down liquor perhaps?  Can't really say but for spending that kind of money I should be well hung over This morning and that didn't happen.So overall I was not really impressed, but like I said in the beginning, to me this was just very ordinary, rather boring food and I would not spend a penny of drinks there if ever going there again.",3,12/8/2019,Jeff P.,1,4,3

The prosciutto that came with the salad was piled on the right of the plate and not incorporated into the salad at all. We agreed after the apps that if the entrees had problems, we were leaving. My husband ordered the rack of lamb special medium rare. It came out well done and gray, and it was chops, not a rack, that had clearly been cooked as chops. My entree was more edible, at least the meat, but the vegetable garnish was pathetic: a handful of undressed, nearly-raw green beans and a few cubes of grease-saturated potato. From other reviews here, I gather this is the standard garnish, so even though most entrees are upwards of $30, the kitchen can't be bothered to customize a fairly small entree menu.I like classic Italian, and that's what this place is, so we weren't expecting innovative menu items or techniques, but we were expecting classic dishes done perfectly, and that's not even close to what we got.

We were able to get out in 1 your, so this was great (close enough). As we waited for food we were given free fresh bread and a concoction of capers, mustard and oil, probably to dip the bread. This was ok, nothing extraordinary. Also, our table got some bruschetta. Typically the bread is pretty nicely grilled or toasted, so that when you add the tomatoes on top, the bread isn't soggy. Not the case with these. They were not very toasted, so became soggy and hard to hold when lifted off the plate, as they would fall apart slightly. Flavor-vise, also very underwhelming. No garlic, and no salt. The entrees on the menu only describe the meat or fish, but no mention on what they come with.

My boyfriend and I had reservations for Valentine's Day and were severely disappointed in the atmosphere, the service, and mostly the food. Upon arrival, we were told that there was a set menu for Valentine's Day. I realize some restaurants do this for holidays, but it would have been helpful to have this information posted on the website or on Open Table, where we made the reservation. I was really excited about a number of pastas on the normal menu, but the fixed menu only offered TWO pastas (neither being what I wanted).This place looks OLD. We were seated in the back section, which felt like a decaying 80s country club. The tables were positioned awkwardly and were way too large for a party of 2. The chairs felt like they were about to fall apart. I even had to ask them to dim the lights because it was shining brightly into my face like an interrogation. And then my boyfriend had to get me a new chair because the arms wouldn't fit under the table and I couldn't scoot in.The server and the buser both didn't speak English very well, so it was very difficult to communicate what we needed and ask specific questions.  Because it was a set menu, we paid $70 (+ and additional $15 for wine tasting) per person and got to choose form a couple appetizers, a couple entrees and a couple pastas. You would assume, that if you're offering a set menu, that you provide your all-star plates, but OY! I could have cried they were so terrible!  The caprese appetizer was tasteless. A nursing home would have done a better job. The gnocchi pasta was okay, but I wasn't impressed (especially for being an Italian restaurant). The chicken entree was hilariously disgusting. It was very thin, with little flavor, bizarre potatoes on the side. It reminded me of a meal at cheap wedding at a Holiday Inn ballroom. I was starving but couldn't even stomach this thing. Woof! The waitress offered to give me more pasta instead, but I just wanted to get out of there.At the end of the day, I think the restaurant wanted to be able to churn people in and out, while still making $$$. They claimed it was a very busy night and the chef needed to keep up, thus the fixed menu, but it didn't seem any busier in there than a normal night at a restaurant (there were empty tables and their ""large group"" was about 8 persons). So either the chef is completely incompetent or they're just greedy and lazy. Regardless, we will NOT be back. I'm horrified that we paid so much money for such lackluster experience.

I'm not sure if they put any sauce on the sandwich but it DEFINITELY needed more. It felt like we were eating a French dip with no au jus sauce, which is obviously pointless. Loaded fries -- solid attempt. Why? Because. The cheese is the best part, and as you can see it wasn't melted very well on the fries, which I think was a shame because without the cheese the fries are mediocre. Over salted and over cooked.

All the goodies in pasta carbonara with the satisfaction of broccolini. The veggie makes it healthy. ;) The pizza came out larger than I was expecting, and I promptly announced to my coworker that there was no way I was finishing it and he should help himself. That... turned out to be a lie. I ate every bit. No Crumb Left Behind. My coworker had the chicken sandwich. He's not a guy to wax poetic about his food, but he said it was good and it surely looked tasty enough. Mentioned he would have preferred it was a chicken breast.",5,12/28/2019,Megan E.,0,0,0

I really appreciate the reviews because this is a hidden gem near the airport. My flight was an hour delayed. Luckily I received the notification prior to returning the rental car, so I decided to boycott the terrible airport food and go somewhere else. This was nearby enough so that I did not need to re-fuel after visiting. I just went straight to the airport!Being my first time at this place, the cashier was very patient with me. I confirmed the broccolini and burrata was not a salad per se (listed under that category), but instead a plate of both. The cashier explained the loaded fries were like poutine, and intrigued, I decided to go ahead and order. They come with bacon, so that's a win already right?The broccolini and burrata was delicious. It was exactly as I expected and reminiscent of my trip of Italy. The broccolini was crispy and not soggy (hate soggy broccolini), and the burrata...OMG I think they could just serve a plate of 3 of them alone, and it would be delicious. Burrata is one of my favorite cheeses. I would not be surprised if you could order the burrata alone off-menu or add to another salad/fries. Yum!The loaded fries were perfect. I have been to Montreal, and if you are going to do poutine wrong, this is the place to do it. This is a bit different because the cheese used is not the same as Montreal, and the gravy is a turkey gravy, but it's delicious. The fries stayed crispy the entire time while I was working, which is a miracle in my opinion. This probably has to be the best mock poutine I have eaten in the USA! The first dish took about 10 minutes to arrive, and the second dish arrived 5 minutes later. There is a free water jug along with utensils, etc. at a station next to the water. Whenever you are done, you can just leave the dirty dishes. I took the to-go menu since I will be traveling to this city more often and truly despise the airport options.

Service was good. They use a ton of super fresh ingredients and high quality food. The prices are fair and the portion sizes are just right. I am very happy we ate here and we will definitely be back. The balance between price, quality and flavor are spot on. Go with confidence and enjoy! Make sure you have a drink with your food. I'll explain later. Overall I will be back for sure. This place is good, but as time goes on I hope it can get better. With a few extra minutes to put themselves in the customers shoes, they'd offer an experience hard to beat in SLC. And I sincerely mean that. One of the hardest things to do while running a restaurant is to have ""customer eyes."" I feel like those that can master this aspect are unstoppable. There is a fine balance between your passion and what's realistic. We went after dark and the corners of their patio are not lit, which is where we were sat. We couldn't see our food which was a huge bummer. I wish they would find a creative way to light their patio better. This would enhance the experience as we did not get to enjoy the artful presentation of the food or understand the way it was plated. More light would be a great idea. The food itself was great with a few complaints. Shining plates were the pizza, tomato tart, and stone fruit salad. The other plates were good too, but lacking the same cohesion.  Honestly id go back just for the tart and pizza. OFF THE CHARTS. The spaghetti was severely undercooked, almost crunchy. Obviously this was not on purpose, but my main issue is that there was an ungodly amount of chunked parmaesan cheese that overpowered the food, which was very light on flavor to begin with. It was very soft tomato sauce, almost white.  They topped it off with full basil leaves which was strange cause I had to break it all up to incooperate it into the dish. Quite frankly the preparation and serving of the pasta was lazy. While it was tastey, it was just lazy. Then again if I'd had some light I could've picked around the cheese....The ravioli was odd but still good and fun. I enjoyed eating it but wasnt a huge fan of the olive/plum/walnut idea. It clashed a little too much for me. The bitterness of the olives were amplified by the tartness of the plumes rather than balancing it.  They were not sweet plums at all which is what I think was the problem. It was a pungent, albeit fun, bite. I'd nix the olives next time. They were an unnecessary bitterness added to a dish that I think was meant to be on the sweeter side of the spectrum.  Alot of the menu was overpowered by bitter, tart and strong flavors. From chunks of sharp parmaesan, to olives, to plums, there was too much bitter without much to mix up my pallet. After eating there my mouth had that feeling that I have after eating too much sour candy. Moral of the story is that  you need a drink other than water to really enjoy this place. The food would've paired very well with a mellow beverage.  Great prices, great ingredients and great ideas. A few small yet essential changes will put Arlo in my top 5 in SLC.",4,8/21/2020,Cory H.,0,1,0

However, when they took us down to be seated, we were simply sat at the bar - which was empty. We were the only ones! Why they made us stand and wait in the vestibule upstairs is beyond me. Not a good way to start off. Next, we decided to order the charcuterie board and some drinks to start. Because of the slow service, this is all we would end up having time for. I ordered red wine and my husband got a beer. This is not the place to go if you want wine; the varietals are not even listed on the menu. When I asked the bartender for a glass of their best Cabernet, I was disgusted. $14 and it tasted like a box wine. By the time the charcuterie board finally appeared, we had no more time to order any additional appetizers or food. The charcuterie board only contained two cheeses and two meats despite its high price tag; and the board was 1/3 sourdough bread, which was hard. Clearly not fresh. I'd rather go to Caputo's and create my own charcuterie board at home. Finally, despite communicating to the bartender that we needed to get to the theater, we sat with my credit card out on the counter of the bar for 20 minutes and the bartender never came back to pick up. I finally just held my credit card in the air like I used to do in college until the bartender noticed. The only reason I am not give this place only one star is because of the cool ambiance.

This is such a delightful place and have been meaning to come here ever since I moved to Salt Lake City. I luckily had the opportunity when some friends came into town for business and I got to recommend some cool low key, local only, awesome finds, if I knew of any. Of course I wasn't about to let my peeps down! I immediately recommended we walk up the street from wherever we were, which happened to be The Blue Iguana which they weren't as much fans of, but hey they didn't ask me my opinion on where to go, ha. Kidding, kind of. Anyways, in case you are wondering they did end up eating at the Red Iguana before they hit the road home to Idaho on Sunday. I had said that the Red Iguana was the best Mexican food in town and if they had a chance to go there before they left, they should. Happy to hear that they loved and enjoyed it which most everyone I know who has been there, has!Back to the amazement that is The Rest. So, you will see Bodega on the street. Bodega is the top of this building and business. The Rest is the bottom and it is so cool, low key, undercover, library, vintage, romantic, dark lit, urban vibe, you won't want to miss out. I will advise you, I don't know what the price range says on Yelp or Google right now, but it is pricey. For the one drink I got there, which I believe was the cheapest on the menu, or I at least was aiming to stay somewhat classy and cheap, that drink alone cost $18. *Insert the shock face emoji* It is on Main St in Salt Lake City by Whiskey Street. You'll see the sign Bodega outside and then the downtown is The Rest. It's a hidden gem and you have to ask about and you can request a table, they will go check if there is anything available. You will hang out upstairs in a crammed area which doesn't compare to the downstairs, so just hang tight. Once you go downstairs you will go down these mysterious eloquent stairs and may think something sketchy is going on. Pretty soon you will appear in what is called ""The Rest"".

Not sure if that was because it was a Sunday and it is usually slow? Either way, though, it was still a nice place to visit.

I love live music, but I like it at a level that still allows people to chat while listening in the background. Service was ok. Our server started out attentive and friendly, but then sort of disappeared when we wanted our check. Another server noticed that we had been sitting awhile and came to check on us-she brought us our tab. I don't fault our server too much-it was a busy night and he was taking care of several tables. The drink menu is impressive-lots of options from wine to beer to cocktails. Prices are a bit on the steep side, but you're paying for ambience and experience, not just the liquor.

With a yelp check-in you got an order of fries so we opted to try the garlic Parmesan fries. They were delivered late in the meal and appeared to be left out too long and overdone. Five minutes later the waitress came out and volunteered to bring a new order, saying she'd noticed their questionable condition.

I can't wait to be back and try the shrimp and grits as well - it looked awesome. Value: this place isn't cheap. We're talking $12-$14 drinks BUT they are anything except ordinary. It's not a spot we come to spend all night but for a fabulous, complex, unique drink or two we will later try to rip off at home? Perfect. The food is a great value!

I am sorry but my party are paying guests and being told that we are only ALLOWED to be present by this man's good grace is absurd.  He approached us AGAIN towards the very end of the night to let us know we still were too loud which is crazy as we were literally whispering.  He asked a bouncer to remove us.  As we had already paid our bill, this wasn't such a huge deal, but had we not already been in the process of leaving I am certain we would have been asked to move or leave by your staff.  This is outrageous considering you are allowing a non-employee to bully, threaten and determine who is ALLOWED to be present in your establishment.  As a fellow paying customer, I find this unacceptable.  For the sake of your business you may want to rethink this mans participation in organizing anything for your establishment.",2,12/19/2019,Katie S.,0,0,0

Ill stop here - I've had some pretty decent brisket over the years so my expectations were admittedly very high. The food came and that's where it fell flat. The brisket was dry. I mean like hard to chew. I had a few pieces that were over a half inch thick, which added to the eating difficulty. It had little to no moisture and most pieces were really tough. I tried three different sauces to help work that cow, but none were useful bringing out flavor. So now for a few good experiences. The Cajun fries were decent, as was the cheddar biscuit.

I really loved the shredded form as it made them much more tender than your typical brussel sprout. The Tin Can Nachos were served in a tin can about the size of my head. The waitress then removed the tin can and out poured delicious tortilla chips covered in generous amounts of melted cheese, jalapenos, our cream, and gaucamole. We opted to add Pulled Pork to the nachos and that was definitely the right choice. Two people could easily share this as an entree.

We've ordered many times from here and been extremely happy with the food and the service. However, our experience last weekend during the Super Bowl left us anything but satisfied. I placed an online order for pick up on the Friday before Super Bowl with the order to be picked up on Sunday at 5:40 PM. While I recognize that Super Bowl Sunday is an incredibly popular time to pick up barbecue I figured that by placing the order two whole days in advance we would be fine to get the food that we were looking for. They charged our card, our order was confirmed and everything seemed good to go until I actually went to pick up the order on Sunday for the Super Bowl. When I got there I couldn't even pull into the curbside pick up spots as they were blocked by multiple cars parked illegally. I figured no big deal, I would just walk in to get our food instead. When I walked in there was about 30 other people trying to get food and I walked up to the register to explain to the person working there that I had a curbside pick up that I had placed as an order two days ago and I was here to pick it up. He literally laughed at me and said ""get in line behind all these other people waiting."" I was a little confused and said ""No I don't think you understand I placed this order two days ago and it's my pickup time, I'm not trying to place an order right now.""  and he literally told me ""it doesn't matter when you place the order it's based on the pick up time."" Needless to say my 5:40  pick up time came and went and there were still a bunch of people ahead of me. I kept waiting and around 5:55 I was informed that they were completely out of food except for some chicken thighs and pulled pork and that they would not be able to fulfill any part of my order except the one order of pulled pork I had actually ordered. I was extremely disappointed and I was really confused as I intentionally ordered  two days in advance but for some reason everybody who ordered the same day of the Super Bowl was taking priority over me just because their pick up times were earlier than mine? That just doesn't make any sense to me. The priority of the order should be based on when the orders were placed, not what time the pick up was. Essentially every single person who waited until Super Bowl Sunday to order, even just an hour before my pickup time, was given priority over my order. All in all, they did try to make it right and gave us three orders of pulled pork with whatever sides they had left and I appreciate that they at least attempted to try to make it right. But it was almost none of the food we had actually ordered. I just think this is an extremely faulty system and I don't know if I'll ever be trusting them again with large orders for any sort of party. It just doesn't make sense to me that somebody who ordered two hours before their pick up time on the same day takes priority over someone like me who ordered two full days in advance, just because their pick up time is five minutes ahead of mine. That doesn't make any sense and I've never heard of a restaurant doing that. Needless to say I don't know if we'll be back.",2,2/15/2021,Emily M.,0,0,0

Turns out, I wasn't the only one with a meat craving.While a bit shorter, the line at the Salt Lake location was also long and impressive. We decided to wait it out and ended up waiting 15 minutes before we were even able to order. Luckily, we got one of the few last ribs orders left and once we ordered, the food came out shortly there after.With all the driving and waiting, the ribs, the BBQ sauce and the hush puppies were definitely worth the extra time and effort.

This Thanksgiving season, we didn't want to spend so much time in the kitchen cooking for such a small bunch so we decided to order out and let R&R prepare our meal.

Their turkey was so juicy and flavorful, we pretty much ate every last bit of it. We were all blown away. The smoke was perfect and added so much deliciousness, but the fact that it wasn't dry and boring made the meal perfect. The sides were great and we just added our own yams and cranberry sauce to complete the table. It was a total steal for the price and totally worth it not to have to slave away in the kitchen.

Ouch. Cold mashed potatoes are not ok. I can work with reheated with gravy in the microwave- that is why I ordered this. The okra, totally my favorite, was under cooked and in clumps.

IT MAY SAVE YOU FROM GETTING COVID-19 AND PUTTING YOUR LIFE IN DANGER.I have to start by saying that the food was good. It did not resist a 15-minute drive back home, and thus, it became cold.

The sides were also good (coleslaw specially)... but they ""forgot"" to give them to me so I had to drive back once again to pick them up. What is truly concerning is how packed the place was during quarantine and COVID-19 times. People eating inside, no one respecting the 6-feet distance, more than 50% not wearing masks. The reason why I decided to purchase my food at R&R was because they were offering ""curbside pick-up"". I was told to park on either slot #1 or #2, both apparently not existent (or that was what I was told by the very cordial guy at the pick-up window). This same guy said that the food was delayed (30-min of extra waiting time) and that I could go inside the restaurant where they were calling people's orders out... I think the point I am trying to make is more than clear: if you decide to go to R&R, you will be putting your health (and perhaps, life) and the one of your loved ones in high risk.

In addition, my chopped beef sandwich (labeled on my box) was definitely not beef but pork (I don't eat pork). The final disaster was the creamed corn which was definitely not edible--there was a very off putting flavor.

In all seriousness, as someone who has hardly eaten out since the beginning of Covid 19, I do appreciate the safety measures that have gone into effect at Caffe Molise. Even if they feel ever so slightly totalitarian. I'm all for it. The American people demanded that they should be able to eat out and voila, safety measures ensue. Incidentally, the hygiene and safety practices are not the only major changes that have occurred since I last visited Caffee Molise in 2013. Let's start with the biggest change, THE LOCATION. And we're not talking about a location change from one quaint restaurant space to another. We are talking about a major overhaul of what used to be a teenage dance club that Molise has claimed as their new home turf. It's a particularly dramatic move seeing as they relocated from a whimsical, quaint little space to a large and dramatic repurposed club venue. At first, I was a bit confused as to what we would find beyond the entrance. I have no idea what the building looks like now compared to how it looked when it was The Bay, but they've managed to create a pretty incredible atmosphere. Caffe Molise went from a small, intimate space to a full-blown, multi-storied, dramatic, high ceilinged affair. It's grandiose and maybe a little bit over the top considering how Molise used to operate. But I can't lie, it's definitely a beautiful space that has edged out a dated and strange former resident. What I'm really excited to try out is the patio. It's tragically become too cold for patio dining now, but it's decidedly on my bucket list when we make it to the other side. I remember the food at Molise being pretty damn good. But not good enough for me to put the restaurant into my regular rotation. For me, this remodel has also extended to the food. I'm not typically a full course appetizer-entrée- and dessert kind of gal, but hey, when it's my bday dinner, I do things a little differently. As a vegetarian, I don't eat meat. However, I do make an exception on my birthday and so I hoped and prayed that Molise would deliver, and not be another meat meal wasted.The dinner unfolded as such: a prosciutto appetizer with bread, arista main dish(spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with a black fig compote) mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables served with a house salad (asiago vinaigrette). The meal ended with a creme Brule and a warm latte. What can I say? The food was far better than I remember. Everything is as good as it sounds, but particularly the Arista and salad. Everyone at my table felt the salad was exceptionally balanced, a really difficult mission to accomplish. The dressing was perfectly distributed, coating everything with a light but a generous dash of vinaigrette. The Arista was bursting with flavor. Whatever spice rub they concocted, I wish they sold it in a bottle. The potatoes and vegetables were the perfect accompaniment. They even managed to somehow roast the figs to perfection. If you're a pork or fig person, this is a MUST try.  Whereas back in 2013 I wasn't too eager to come back, Caffe Molise has now definitely caught my interest. Perhaps it will be a long time before I get back out to a restaurant, but I'll make it to your patio one day, SOMEWAY, SOMEHOW.",4,10/28/2020,Lizzie W.,1,1,1

Excited to try it out for the hubby's birthday!They have signs on the doors and markings on the ground, please read the signs before you try to enter. They give you all the info you need for what to expect.  Masks are required when entering and leaving and any time you are not at the table. The host will come out to greet you. When they are ready for you, you will stop in foyer and have temp taken (touchless thermometer) and fill out a contact sheet (this is important in the event of an exposure). They provide masks if you don't have one with you. The menu is digital now so you just scan a QR code and view it on your phone. This is GENIUS so they don't have to have physical menus to wipe down constantly or throw away each time.Hubby ordered the flat iron prime special with fingerling potatoes, asparagus and squash. The steak was perfectly seared and it was tender and incredibly juicy. The reduction sauce on top was not overpowering and had excellent flavor and the avocado tasted fresh.  Potatoes were roasted nicely and the veggies were still crisp with great flavor. I ordered the gnocchi di patate. Gnocchi is usually my go-to dish when testing out Italian food, and they certainly did not disappoint! I can't stand when gnocchi is swimming in sauce and that was not the case here. The tomato cream sauce was nice and rich without drowning the dish. It was the perfect amount to compliment the gnocchi and the flavor was robust without being overpowering. The basil and pine nuts just capped off the dish giving it that extra something special as the flavors of everything come together in my mouth. And the gnocchi...perfectly cooked pillows that just seem to melt in your mouth as you eat. I absolutely loved this and would definitely order again!!Hubby ordered an Old Fashioned to drink and he thoroughly enjoyed being able to have a drink made by a bartender for the first time in months! I started with just water but could not resist ordering an Italian soda. I branched out from the normal Vanilla and tried the orange at our server Trent's recommendation, and it was so yummy tasted just like a Creamsicle!!Trent was a fantastic server and I appreciate all of the work the entire staff is doing to keep us safe while we enjoy a night out to celebrate the hubby's birthday. I haven't wanted to eat at a restaurant the last several months, and this experience definitely put my mind at ease.

Caffé Molise also offers delicious italian sodas amongst other unique non alcoholic drinks for those of us who are under 21 but enjoy a fancy beverage. In terms of service...

Prior to moving into their new location, we enjoyed many meals on their patio and alway had a great experience. It had been a long time since our last visit. Too long, to be honest. Last night, we decided to celebrate our Valentines Day dinner (a day late); as they were booked on the 14th. This was the first time we have visited them, since moving into the historic Eagle Building. First impressions... this is such an incredible building. It's historic design is absolutely amazing. From the moment, you begin your climb up the wide concrete steps, to entering through the front door, it's impressive. How they have chosen to decorate the restaurant reminded me off the many fine establishments I have had the opportunity to visit in downtown Chicago and New York City. As you are seated, you feel like you are dining in one of the finest establishments in Salt Lake. The vibe is romantic and elegant. The craftsmanship of the woodwork is beautiful. On to the menu. For those that enjoy a robust and fine wine selection... you will love what Caffé Molise has to offer. There are many choices, when it comes to appetizers and their main courses are thoughtfully created and prepared using the finest of fresh ingredients. There is something for everyone's liking. My wife usually orders her tried and true favorite, Pappardelle al Sugo; which is House-made fresh pappardelle tossed with a savory, slow-cooked sauce of pork and beef with tomatoes, topped with Asiago. I have tried many dishes in past, but found my favorite to be the Ravioli con Melanzana; which is Roasted eggplant and mozzarella in egg pasta with red bell pepper and tomato coulis, topped with crumbled chevre.Much to my disappointment, they discontinued this item. (Please update your menu, both on your webpage and physical menu.) I had been thinking about this dish with great anticipation. Our server told us this item had been discontinued months ago and been replaced with a mushroom ravioli of sorts, covered in an alfredo type. sauce. (I decided to give this dish a try.)So here's the scoring of our experience. Service: OUCH!!!!! Our server was about as impersonal as they come. I was a few minutes late to the table, when the salads arrived. When he stopped by, he asked if we needed anything else. As I began to tell him  I would like to order a drink, he had already walked away, to assist with placing the neighboring tables desserts. Literally,walked away in the middle of my sentence. As if the table runner that was holding the desserts was unable to handle this task on her own. When he returned, he nonchalantly addressed me by saying, ""sorry, what did you want?""  Once I placed my drink order, there was no confirmation... just him vanishing again. This is how the entire evening went with him, until it was time to drop off the check. All of a sudden, we mattered and he cared about how we enjoyed our evening. Out of respect, I will not share his name. However, he truly diminished the experience and if he were to be assigned to our table again in the future, I would requests a change or just leave. 1 Star for our server friend. (Disclaimer: I waited tables for 4 years and seldom criticize) Food:The ravioli plate that I ordered, in place of the discontinued eggplant dish, was definitely not accompanied with an alfredo sauce . It was a pesto and strong cheese mix. (Possibly goat cheese or gorgonzola type cheese -  No idea.) Luckily , I like strong cheeses, so I enjoyed it and found it to be flavorful. Just wish I knew what it was and what is was called. Obviously, our server didn't help much on the name and description. My wife's favorite dish, came out overcooked and dry on parts ofthe noodles. Consistent with sitting under a warmer for an extended length of time. Management:AWESOME!!!!! One of the managers stopped by our table, near the end of our dinner and asked how our meal was. My wife was hesitant to share her disappointment, but after sensing something was wrong, she convinced my wife to share. This manager couldn't have been more engaged and apologetic. After offering to bring out a replacement dish, a different dish or a dessert... we respectfully declined with appreciation; as we needed to leave to attend another engagement. The offer itself was enough. Upon receiving our bill, our server stated his manager felt that we deserved better and had comped my wife's meal. TOTALLY UNEXPECTED and very kind and thoughtful. Truthfully... she made our night, because she showed us just how important we wereas a customer. She is an absolute sweetheart!!!! We will definitely be back and Caffé Molise will always maintain a high place on our list of favorites. Everyone can have a bad night and last night was very unusual for such an amazing restaurant.

The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and was super sweet to our 3yr old daughter. We were immediately upon check in taken to our table. We were on the top floor which has several level of stairs, good thing I was in flats. They do have an elevator for use as well. Our waiter was also very personable. Our issue really comes with the timing and very slow service, given the holiday it was not busy at the time we were there, it did get busier as we left. The server took a very long time at everything, we had enough time to decide on everything and ordered our entire meal including appetizers at one time, giving the impression that we did not want to dally as we have a child with us. Our appetizers came out in good time but it just seemed that the waiter forgot about us throughout the rest of the night. We waited for about 15 minutes after we finished our appetizers to ask for the bread he had offered earlier, he then remembered we had salads and had those sent out, our meal arrived after about 40 minutes after our appetizers and had clearly been sitting out for some time as my mashed potatoes and chicken had kinda hardened over and were cold. By the time our meal arrived we had been there for just under an hour and our 3yr old was starting to get antsy, we asked to have the rest of our meals boxed to take home and instead of taking it back he brought out boxes and gave some odd excuse for not taking it back himself. Needless to say while in the past we have really enjoyed our dinners ar Cafe Molise we will probably think twice about returning. Good service is very important to us and we felt like we were not considered valued patrons.",2,2/15/2020,Nichole L.,0,0,0

When I told her that the greens in the salad were bad and wilted she said oh OK I'll take it away for you.  The proper answer would have been I'm sorry and let me do something to make that up to you. I did not even bother telling her that every glass of wine tasted like it's been open for days and was completely turned. I had the Pappardelle, which was honestly OK. That means the texture of the pasta was OK. But the sauce had absolutely no flavor. The tiramisu was also OK. I would say it's equivalent of what I could buy at a supermarket. None of this food was real Italian and why I'm most disappointed about that is that some of the reviews actually raved about it being real Italian food.

I had a hard time making a decision on what to order, but Gordon gave his honest and enthusiastic opinion and I chose the Penne di Caprino.

I took the rest home, and the woman that brought by the box packed it up for me and gave me some tips on how to best reheat it. We ended our meal with espresso and a shared tiramisu.

This is a restaurant I have been to a handful of times before, and they have all been mediocre experiences. I had high hopes that this time would be better, as they moved locations in the past year or so, to a beautifully remodeled building. However, it was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Our party made reservations many days in advance (there were 7 of us). Myself and another friend arrived earlier than the other guests so we were seated right away. When the other guests arrived they somehow ""lost"" the reservation or forgot that they seated only half the party, leaving the rest of the group to wait for a table to become available, for 30 min. Meanwhile, the other half of the group waited upstairs for everyone to arrive. In total we waited for an hour before the whole situation was worked out. We were not comped in any way for this mishap. Our server was horrible. Not only did our food take forever to arrive, but she was incredibly rude, anytime a plate or water glass was refilled it was slammed down on the table. 3 of the 7 people at the table ordered the vegetarian entree, the eggplant ""meatballs"". Which we had in the past, and they were pretty good. However, this time they were completely inedible. It was like trying to saw a rock with a butter knife. Which I didn't even know it was possible to over cook eggplant to the point that it turns that dry and hard. Not to mention EVERYTHING, was coated in that nasty, cheap Parmesan cheese fluff...not even real Parmesan flakes. The sauce was horrible and sparse. Luckily the dessert was pretty decent. That was the only redemptive part of the evening. All in all, we left 3 and half hours later, and paid $50 a person for horrible food and awful service.

Keep in mind that the restaurant was not even at 25% capacity. Waitress finally came and took our drink order and by that time we knew what appetizers we wanted. Order our appetizers and our waitress was not seen for a good 30 minutes... this could be because someone was at the bar that knew the waitresses there who brought their Nintendo Switch in so the waitresses decided to play video games instead of serves their guests. Even had time to take pictures which more important then coming and taking our entree order. Waitress finally arrives with our appetizers first the olives and pickles which came first then the bone marrow which me and my guest where exited about, she dropped off the appetizer and no care to ask if we needed any plates to eat which I had to ask for. Dug in one bone was so overcooked and dried out that you couldn't scrap anything out of it. The other two over 45% of the bone was the same way. We discussed this with our waitress and she stated that she would go ahead and take it off the ticket since most of it was over cooked. We both received our entree which were both great. Time came to pay our check... I guessI should have looked it over because although our waitress said she would take the bone marrow appetizer off since most of it was overcooked,Looking at my receipt she ended up charging me$9.50 of the $12 which was how much it cost for the appetizer. If any of the owners or managers read this.. make sure your waitresses aren't to distracted with playing video games to where they aren't tending to their guests. All in all I'll give my experience a 3 out f 5 stars. Hopefully the next time I decide to dine in my waitress along with the others aren't to busyPlaying games.

They have a number of different versions with different alcohols, I stuck with original but used raspberry vodka for a twist.  Fantastic, second one I opted for the extra $2 upgrade to use ginger beer with alcohol.  So while it was more potent, I preferred the mule with the non-alcohol ginger beer as the ginger flavor had more snap/zip to it.  Split the duck confit fries, scallops, boneless wings with my buddy.  All were fantastic. Note the wings are boneless, I missed that and I prefer bone-in wings, but these were still really good and it was great tender meat that wasn't over battered like most boneless wings.  Also note music usually starts at 10pm and the vibe switches from a chill dinner/bar joint to a night scene with waitresses switching into bustier tops etc. Keep in mind this place is named after a legal brothel that used to be here.  But to be honest, since I'm hitting this place while traveling for work, I'm usually beat by 10:30 so I can't comment too much on the night scene other than it starts to get full at 10:00 and there seems to be a fun crowd that gathers.  Enjoy!",5,3/14/2020,Scott S.,1,1,0

I could've eaten that and not share and be fine with it.  The roasted bone marrow is on a whole new level!! The combination of the crostini, the chimichurri and marrow was excellent! For dinner we ordered the Pepitas Crusted  Sea Scallops and the London Prime Ribeye. Again, I can't say enough on how down right delicious this all was!!! Those sea scallops were done just right! Tender and deliciously crusted! The ribeye was perfection!! Ugh, I already want to go back!

The vibe is awesome, and they even have a cute little area in a far corner that gets decorated differently every couple of weeks.Now let's talk about the coffee. Their coffee is very high quality and strong. They have a cloud coffee (off menu) with cotton candy which is very unique. I love their mocha, but my favorite drink is definitely the chai tea. I tried both iced and hot, and the iced chai is a big winner.Besides tea and coffee, they have also have small plates. Their salmon brushetta is sooooo delicious, I could eat several plates of those! Their avocado toast and spring salad are also wonderful.

We ordered/paid up front (due to COVID) at the stand  2 servings of The Pig Breakfast with the $2 upgrade to each meal for a ""house made veggie patty"" as listed on the menu. When our food was brought out, very quickly (impressed by the fast service!) the server said he had 2 pig breakfasts with portobello mushrooms. We said ""oops sorry those must not be ours as we got the veggie patty"" and he apologized and promptly went back to the kitchen to check on the order. When he came back we were informed by the server that they were out of the veggie patty and we had been given the portobello mushroom as a substitute and placed the meals in front of us. We wish that we had been given the option to confirm we would like that substitution or been given the option to decline and have the $2/meal refunded back to us. I walked up and explained this situation to the manager on staff who told me ""if you read the menu it says it's a mushroom served"". Nowhere on the menu did it state this but said ""house made veggie patty"" as a replacement for meat. After showing him the menu online I stated I simply would just like the $4 back that we had paid for this. He seemed upset but told me to get my card and then told me he was refunding $16 (2 pig breakfasts) and handed me a receipt. When I got back to my table I noticed this was someone else's receipt with a different name and charge so I went back up to let him know I had the wrong receipt. He again seemed upset with me and abruptly said ""I'll find you a receipt and I've already refunded you more than was necessary"". I apologized and agreed. I didn't want to bother him again so we left without ever receiving a receipt and at this time I've still received no refund to my card.

I immediately though, whelp, it's going to take a while for us to get our food. And yes, I was correct! I sat and waited as a Lady and her two little boys got their food. They were the party who had ordered before us. After some time, the couple that had placed their order, after we had sat, was now getting theirs! Wait a minute now! It's been over a half an hour where's our food!? Well it wasn't soon after because the next group that came after said couple was now getting their food! Unbelievable!My wife had let out a ""finally!"" frustration when our food was finally brought out. Our waiter didn't provide us with as explanation for the delay nor did I get a refill on my water. All of our plate looked good, but tasted so meh. The chicken on both of our plates were tasteless. I took one taste of potatoes that came with my chicken and biscuits and never ate them again. The fries and gravy was underwhelming. I took the fired egg and threw them on chicken and biscuit sandwich for some flavor. The cinnamon biscuit was meh too! Beignets were also ordered, but no photos were taken of them. They taste nothing like Beignets, but they were better than the cinnamon biscuits. We ended up wasting a lot our food because they just weren't good. A disappointment and no way can I recommend this place to anyone. We had Brunch at Sweet Lake Biscuits & Limeade a week before and would much recommend them over this place here. 2 stars because price.",2,7/25/2020,Sam K.,0,2,0

I understand COVID has things a little turned upside down but basic service should not be one of them.When we arrived, the girl at the counter told us to download the menu, which we did, and let us know our table was outside on the patio. She didn't tell us exactly which table was ours, so we guessed, and also didn't tell us we needed to order with her before sitting down. We had gone to our table and were waiting for someone to take our order for about 15 minutes before she finally waved to us to place our order inside.While we were waiting on our food, the trash came to be collected. Not a problem, other than we were seated right next to a long row of cans. When the cans were returned the lids did not close. The smell was terrible! My husband went inside to let one of the wait staff know about the cans and smell. After they had not come to close the lids for about 10 minutes, our son went to close the lids, fortunately right as our food was coming out. Eventually, someone from the restaurant came to move the cans around back and away from the patio area. At no time did he apologize for the inconvenience or acknowledge that my son had closed the lids. He essentially ignored us altogether. Although there was nothing the restaurant could do about it, food had fallen onto the hot street and was beginning to attract flies. Not making for a pleasant dining experience, as you can imagine.As for the food, it was just ok. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had no flavor and I didn't finish it. The waffle was good. I ordered coffee which had grounds in the bottom of the cup. My husband had the hash with ""country ham."" The ham was not the country ham we are used to in the south. It was just regular ham. He thought it was pretty good though. My son had the waffles with fruit. He thought it was good also...however the wait staff failed to bring his milk to him after being asked several times.Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to friends or family traveling to SLC. It was nothing to write home about, although the locals seemed to like it as there were several parties waiting as we were leaving. Pig and A Jelly Jar did not live up to our expectations and we were disappointed with our last SLC dining experience.",2,7/24/2020,Ŧiffany B.,1,0,0

Today, however, I was in around the area again and this time, I wanted to try something else. While standing in line, I've noticed that the restaurant is quite busy at 2:30pm in the afternoon on a Saturday in the winter time. I ordered the Bành Mì (sandwich) -- I choose the ""All Chay"" option. After, say 5 minutes or so, the order came out. I asked for it to go so the chef wrapped it in foil paper and placed inside a brown bag! The sand which was relatively warm and the bread is just right--not too brittle nor too soft. I have got to say, this is by far the best Bành Mì sandwich I've ever had--that is saying allot because if you grew up on eating these sandwiches in Southern California with the various and multi-location of the Lee's Sandwich Shops throughout all of California, you'll know that this here shop, All Chay, makes the best Sandwich I've had in a loooooonnnggg time!!

How can Vietnamese food be vegan?! Will it actually taste good? Does it actually taste like it's intended dish??? YES!!!

The restaurant itself was simple and humble. Utensils, sauces, and water is self-serve. You order at the counter and the food is brought to you. All the employees were really nice and willing to explain the dishes. We ordered the following:- Curry Fried Rice: SO GOOD! It was flavorful and contained veggies and a ""meat"" (kind of like nam nung pork patty but vegan obviously). I loved this and would so get this again!- Mongolian BBQ Bun (dry vermicelli noodle bowl): I was curious what the ""fish sauce"" dressing for this noodle bowl would taste like and it was delicious! Slightly sweet and acidic, while it didn't taste like fish sauce it perfectly complemented the noodle bowl. The BBQ ""meat"" had a similar texture as tempeh and had a slightly sweet BBQ pork flavor. - Pho: Definitely most skeptical about the pho but it was amazing! I've had vegetarian pho before and enjoy the cleaner, lighter taste of veggie broths. The pho contained lots of vegetables and tofu as toppings and with all the sauces, tasted just as good as beef pho. - Bean Curd Bahn Mi: I just had a bite of this and while probably my least favorite out of all we tried, I love banh mi and all the flavors like the pickled veggies, the crispy French bread, and the fried bean curd tastes just as satisfying as a meat banh mi.

FOOD: Regarding their eats, I tasted the following:===Not recommend===*Summer Rolls ($2.95): Fried tofu with vermicelli, bean sprouts, jicama, carrot, lettuce, mints, and cucumber. I didn't find it flavorful or rightful wrapped. I liked their peanut sauce, though.  *Spicy Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi ($5.95): Super chewy bread instead of a crunchy exterior and soft interior. I would not recommend it, either. But it does it the spot if you're in need. ===Recommend===Pho Chay: Surprisingly, the dish I thought would be the best wasn't. It had a good depth to it, and it didn't taste overly salty. III. SERVICE: No problems here. I liked the person who took the order, and the food came out blazingly quick.IV. PRICES: Hard to complain when a stomach-filling meal costs less than $20.V. OVERALL: Even though I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, All Chay seemed like legit restaurant to try vegetarian Vietnamese food.

I had very low expectations, but boy did the food blow me away. I ordered the ""beef"" pho and ocean seafood dish. I hadn't had decent food in a long time (again, too lazy to cook, vegans actually have great food). The pho broth was delicious, it did not taste artificial.

Free cold water is available self serve style along with a refrigerator filled with other types of soda, a table set up to bus your own dirty dishes and another table with silverware and sauces to spice up your dish if so inclined.I admit, I had the ginger tofu with rice and side vegetables with a nice dipping sauce on the side along with the Four Season Rolls which were 4 spring rolls filled with fresh ingredients and side sauces. My husband shared the spring rolls and enjoyed the rice dish with Teriyaki Chicken. We both were quite satisfied upon leaving without feeling overstuffed and feeling quite virtuous for enjoying such a healthy meal! :)This evening we were surprised with a free eggless flan! We were a bit dubious about the dish when we were presented with it but tried it to be polite and WOW! Really? Eggless flan with decaf coffee splashed on top? It was soooo yummy!

One extra note: The older gentleman that works there.....I believe he is part of the family that owns All Chay.......what a sweet man.

I am first excited by their options when I see them; a ton of vegetarian/vegan items! However, I usually leave fairly underwhelmed. I think the inside is very fun, with a lot of aspects to look at. It's also in a good location for anyone working in the City County building. I was first drawn here by noting all of their options for non meat eaters. They have a house made lentil patty that is used in burgers and such, and I think this is the start of my underwhelming feelings. The patty tends to be on the tasteless side. The very first thing I ever ordered here was their ""The Bird"". This is a combo of small salad, veggies, small dab of hummus and a veggie burger (without a bun or the fixin's). I didn't realize the latter half was so, and this lack of ""burger"" type left me wondering about the price. I left feeling like I paid a lot more than it was worth.The second visit, I got the actual veggie burger. It's honestly on the pricier side of what you get. A simple patty on bun with some toppings. No fries, no side. I ordered fries separately so it wasn't so simple. I make my own veggie burgers at home, so I'm really kind of disappointed with theirs. Price wise, taste wise, etc. Which makes me upset, because I really appreciate an establishment that makes their own in house! My third visit I only made because my cousin wanted to stop in. This time around, I decided to try something from their breakfast part of the menu: vegan smothered burrito. It was a smaller sized burrito but smothered in a delicious sauce with a generous side of potatoes! This meal made up for my two previous lackluster ones. Overall, I'm glad there are a ton of veggie options at Cytybyrd, but if I have the choice to go elsewhere, I will. I don't think this place is bad whatsoever, it's just very underwhelming to me.

You are always greeted with a smile.My personal favorites are the Monte Cristo (ham, swiss, mayonnaise) served on french toast, and the Reuben. Breakfast is also worth trying. The mixed fries (sweet potato and regular) are definitely a step above what you find in most run of the mill restaurants.  I suppose this is because Cytybyrd actually makes all of their meals from scratch.

The mint leaves in between the fried roll and rice paper were everything. We both got green curry and we scooped up every last bite! The staff was friendly and the bill wasn't too bad. Would definitely recommend this place for a fun night out, especially for plant-based peeps! Sooo many delicious options in a chill environment.",5,4/15/2021,Hannah N.,0,0,0

It turns out that I was just always eating the wrong spicy food. It took me almost 40 years, but I finally found the good stuff. (Spoiler alert-it's here. At Ginger Street.)My wife and I wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day a little early to avoid the crowds, and we wanted to try something new. I found this restaurant on Yelp and selected it based on a few things: 1) reviews were fantastic (duh)2) location was near where we would be that night 3) they offered reservations through Yelp Those were all important factors and I was excited to give it a try. We arrived a little early-our stomachs were growling and we wanted to eat sooner than we thought we would. Not a problem! We were immediately welcomed and seated. We had scanned the menu ahead of time since this was a new place for us, but still downloaded the menu to our phones using the QR code on the table. This helped us remember what we had pre-decided. I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken Stir Fry and my wife had the Pad Thai with chicken. We also ordered the Steamed Pork Dumplings to share. (Who are we kidding? We shared everything. We wanted to try it all!) The first bite was good. Sure, this is going to be fine. Then I had another bite and another and another. Each one got progressively better. I'm not sure how that happens-maybe the ingredients needed time to warm up to each other in my mouth or perhaps, like a good bottle of wine, it gets better over time...but whatever it was-I was falling in love minute by minute. I had to be careful not to make my wife jealous. I tried hers and it was also delicious. She  wanted me to try a bite paired with a piece of cilantro. Nah, that stuff is just garnish. But she insisted and I relented. That combination is like Barack and Michelle-they just GO together. They compliment each other perfectly. In addition to spectacular food, there was a DJ spinning records, adding to the overall funky vibe of the place. I appreciated that we didn't hear boring music piped in AND that it was as a reasonable volume. I love the tunes, but I also love conversation. This was the best of both worlds. As we were leaving, we were greeted by who we later learned to be the owner. He asked how our meal was, how we heard about them and told us about a few other restaurants that he owns that we ought to try. He also introduced us to the lady who decorated the entire place for Valentine's Day (it looked remarkable, by the way!) It was really cool to chat with him briefly and feel welcome. We are excited to return soon!My only complaint-or really note to myself for next time-was the stools. My wife has a bad back and needs a regular chair with back support. The table we were seating at had tall stools. I did see other tables nearby with proper chairs, so we'll just request to sit at one of those. No worries!",5,2/13/2021,Nycole R.,8,9,1

My goal was to not be aggressive but to inform others about my personal experience.I'm not here to start an argument, but I have noticed that the person who responds happens to be very passive aggressive towards low ratings, which is understandable...  but remember to take it as constructive criticism. I would have been more open to trying this place out again if the response I got was more focused on accountability. What I saw vs. what was said does not match up exactly, and it shouldn't matter if you're not on the clock to mask up, as the current pandemic doesn't end because your shift does. Again, please take this constructively. --Oof. Heard lots of good and bad things about this place. One of the things I heard was that their ice cream was on the good side. So I went to try it out and wow, I was in for an emotional rollercoaster. You can quickly order ice cream from a ""to-go"" window where you ring a doorbell. Service was prompt and the girl was really nice! Some items on their menu was outdated (they don't serve cold pressed juice anymore) and I just ordered my soft serve. The soft serve machine is like right in front of the to-go window and oh boy, let me tell you what I saw. The girl grabbed a guy, who I assume was either the manager or a supervisor? They both went to the soft serve machine and looked like they couldn't get it to work. The guy did NOT have a mask on, nor anywhere in sight on his body. He didn't have a mask tucked in his pocket somewhere cause he was meaning to put it on or anything. He was mask-free, AND then he used his gloveless fingers to touch parts of the machine that would be unsanitary!

We ordered more than we needed just because we wanted to try so much. The waffle topped with real-fruit berry sauce and whipped cream was crispy on the outside, yet light and moist on the inside. The hand rolled beignets were reflected the crispy, yet soft nature of the waffle and were generously rolled in a cinnamon sugar which was complemented by the fresh coconut milk. The kimchi fried rice was both satisfying and rich with this fusion of the Korean classic topped with a freshly fried egg and the crunchy rice bits that are a favorite of asian rice connoisseurs (and we know Korea). Our son could not stop at one, nor two orders of pork dumplings, but this 17 year-old teen could not stop until he had consumed the freshly sauced third plate.

The rice was perfect - soft and fluffy with individual grains and they had that distinctive light floral aroma that Jasmine rice is known for. You can tell that all the dishes are cooked to order and with care.Speaking of bold flavor, my husband's sandwich was definitely really spicy - easily the spiciest thing we've had in Salt Lake. So if you're sensitive, be aware of the spice level. He ended up picking a few of the jalapenos off and it ended up being a great spice level for him. We were really impressed that a place in Salt Lake was bold enough to make food this spicy because we've really struggled to find decently spicy food around these parts. It was kind of like a cross between a Nashville hot and a bahn mi. Really great to try if you're hesitant about Asian food!We also appreciated that they stapled the bag shut so we could tell if our food had been tampered with. Not enough places do this! It's definitely appreciated!The only criticism I have is about the wonton wrappers for their dumplings being a little off game. I'm not expecting a place like this to make their own or anything but the flavors from the wrappers are veering to much in the ravioli territory and needs to be brought back east a bit. Not sure what it is, if they're gluten free or not eggy enough, just seemed a bit off on the style.We'll definitely be ordering again! And after the pandemic, we'll be back to dine in. I can't wait to enjoy this food with some of their house made cocktails! Everything we ordered was delicious!",4,9/26/2020,Daniella B.,2,3,1

TLDR; if you want amazing Asian food, take your hungry selves elsewhere.Shrimp dumplings: Only came with 3 pieces. I'm assuming its their take on spicy wontons. Drenched in sauce that was waaaay too salty. It was so overpowering that you could hardly taste the shrimp. For those who do have peanut allergy, BEWARE!!! Despite noting our peanut allergy, it was definitely still in the dish.Pork dumplings: The potstickers were steamed, and the bed of sauce it laid on top of was amazing. However, I feel as though they put too much emphasis on the sauce that the potsticker/dumpling itself lacked flavor. Also for something (possibly) steamed, our pork was very dry and dense. Pad Thai: Perhaps the best dish! The noodles were not cooked to what I am used to-- al dente-- nevertheless, good. Their take has the egg sunny side up topped on the noodles, rather than scrambled in. What made the dish was the shrimp, well seasoned & perfectly cooked!Service: POOR with so much attitude. I had to bump down another star. Since it was our first time here, we did not immediately know what to get so we took time to go through the menu before ordering--as one normally would. Upon asking the host what the most popular dishes were, we were met with discouraging attitude rather than one that was passionate about the food they offered. We also did mention our peanut allergy, and the host did ask again to confirm and notated it on our ticket (much appreciated). Unfortunately, the sauce that the shrimp dumplings were drenched in DID indeed contain peanuts. I personally went up to another worker who also confirmed with chef himself that the shrimp dumplings apparently did not have peanuts. I find it very disappointing and ironic that the chef does not know the ingredients that are in the food they are serving. Allergies alone are a very serious health matter. Luckily we caught it within the first bite so the reaction was mild. This is a warning to anyone else who possibly has a more severe reaction to peanuts to BEWARE as they do not pay much attention to that. I'm assuming that it was the supervisor that we had spoken with, he initially did not take our concern seriously, in fact approached us with attitude saying ""What's the problem?"" Suggesting a ""what do you want me to do about it"" vibe, extremely disappointing. Safe to say, will not be returning.",2,9/25/2020,Gretchen S.,5,17,6

And, in all fairness easily competes with some of the best Thai i have ever eaten.I have put off the review, because when i did, i would have to go back and drop everyone else at least a star in comparison to be fair how good this is.Its a tiny little shop, with mostly outdoor seating, (or take it to the park across the street like we did).The place is high speed low drag, orders go fast, portions are very generous, and am still trying to find something they are not good at.  they provide hot dry chili and lime with every dish, and that is a sign that they really get me without knowing me at all. Dishes ratings are going to look boring, but here goes:Drunken noodles 5 stars: it was a picture of this dish that got my wife and I to drive 45 minutes to SLC in the middle of a riot, to try. Its the best version I have had, and now my current favorite thai noodle dish. It passes Pad See Ew and Pad THai at my other favorite Thai in the AZ, which is saying something. rich, flavorful, and the noodles are done just right.Pineapple Fried Rice 5 stars: flavorful with ingredients different than the norm, but still amazing. sprinkle some of the dry chili on top and stick a fork in anyone who reaches for a taste.Panang Curry, 10 stars on a 5 scale: OMFH! the best i have ever had, no hyperbole. Thick rich coconut sauce, nice heat (level 3-4), and crisp tender vegetables that defy logic. How do they do that? I want to sneak in and watch some time. I have gotten beef and pork different times, and they were both good.Thai fried rice: 5 stars (see the trend?) tasty although i prefer the pineapple, and i don't really like thai basil, but they make it dominate here without overwhelming. The flavor balance is perfect, and i cant stop eating it.Pad Thai 4 stars: the pretty charming girl until you see her drunken noodle sister, and then she fades into the wall paper. Tasty, but not on the future menu choice for us, sorry sis! my fav place in AZ can sigh in relief, since they still do it better, but on nothing else!Massaman Curry 5 stars: Wifes fav, and i admit its pretty good, and i normally don't care as much for massaman. Veg and meat and potatoes done perfect again, and we have eaten here enough to know its not an accident.Overall, you get the drift, its not high end, its a couple of very hardworking people who produce great thai, and you can take out and sit in the nice weather and eat.

We were really excited to try Belgian waffles made by Belgians; unfortunately, we weren't all that impressed.We thought the size of the waffle was really, really small for the price. It could literally fit on the palm of my hand (and my hands are petite!). The waffles were made with brown sugar and should've had some sort of a crunch, but even the portions that didn't have strawberries or syrup on it had no crunch whatsoever. In addition, the batter must've not been well mixed because some portions of the waffle had more brown sugar than others, making it such a shock of sugariness when you eat the wrong part!We also tried the Croque Madame with the egg on top with fries. The sandwich was definitely better than the waffle, but overall I thought that it was just ok, nothing super spectacular. The fries were ok and they had different dipping sauces. Overall I would not recommend a stop by this place - definitely not for the waffle, but maybe just for a quick bite of the sandwich.",3,4/24/2020,Duyen N.,0,1,0

We loved it so much, we didn't stop talking about going back, then the pandemic happened and we haven't been able to travel all year. When my birthday approached this year, my wonderful husband decided to take me to Veneto and do the pre-fixed menu. It was an absolutely wonderful experience! Yes, it is expensive and risky to dine in but it's both cheaper and more responsible than traveling to Italy right now! Veneto does do take out but the take out options are different than their dine in menu. Besides the other customers speaking English, the food and the experience feels like you've suddenly found yourself in Italy! You can definitely see the northern influence on the food. Our pre-fixed menu included a variety of fresh vegetables, stuffed pastas, corn products, perfectly cooked steak, fish, a light cocktail, and dessert. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of the meal. I don't know how Italians are so skinny! If you want the true Italian experience, I recommend the pre-fixed menu. A traditional Italian dinner is large, long, with multiple courses, and goes late into the night.They have a super long and somewhat complex wine menu. We wanted to explore their wine menu but we didn't want to spring for the wine tasting that's paired with the pre-fixed menu so we decided to just order a bottle to share. Unfortunately they do not publish their wine menu online, so you'll have to decide if it's worth it before you go to buy a bottle ahead of time or just go with their menu. Their wines have a huge range of prices, going all the way up to $1000 or more. The cheapest bottle we saw was $40. We ended up springing for a Sangiovese that was $75. That same bottle sells at the liquor store for about $25 so if we would have bought it in advance and paid the corkage fee ($35), we could have saved about $10 but then we wouldn't have had the opportunity to choose from their well curated wine menu. Because I don't know much when it comes to wine, I think $10 is a good price to pay to be able choose from a well curated list. From what we saw, they do not sell much wine by the glass. If you're a wine aficionado, maybe the wine sample pairing would have been more up your alley. I thought the wine we ordered was amazing and typical for the style but, again, I'm no wine connoisseur.When we were deciding between ordering the pre-fixed menu and ordering a la carte off the menu, we thought the pre-fixed menu was a no-brainer. Their portions are not huge so by the time you order several items off the menu, you might as well pay for the pre-fixed dinner. Of course, even if one person at the table wants the pre-fixed dinner, everyone must order it so depending on the size of your group and what everyone wants, it might be better to just order a la carte.Because of COVID, a reservation is highly recommended but be sure to stick to your plan! It's okay, most of us don't have much else going on right now anyway! They take a credit card number to make the reservation and will charge you if you're a no-show. Makes sense, they've had to significantly reduce their seating so they want to make sure you show up! Because of the reduced capacity, we were only able to get a later dinner spot, but if that happens to you, don't be sad! Real Italians don't eat dinner earlier than 9pm! So you'll just be getting a more authentic experience if that happens to you too! Just have a few light snacks at home to tide you over until it's time to show up for your reservation. Italians call that ""aperitivo""!Bonus! Veneto is super Italian, like so Italian, they don't expect a tip. In fact, if you do tip, the tip is donated to local charities. Yes, it's still expensive but you don't need to budget an extra 20% for tip if you don't want to. Similar to restaurants in Italy, there is a small table fee. Basically in Italy, every restaurant charges a table fee so if you wanted to stand at the bar and quickly drink an espresso or order take-out, you don't have to pay the table fee. Veneto doesn't have a bar for sipping espresso but it's so common in Italy to charge a table fee that even restaurants that don't have a bar still charge it. Even so, the table fee is far less than what most people would tip. I think our table fee was about $8 for example.We absolutely loved our experience! I've decided to disclose that our bill ended up totaling around $450 (2 pre-fixed dinners + 1 bottle of wine + espresso). We actually budgeted over $500 for our meal but were pleasantly surprised at the end when we didn't have to tip. Maybe we would have done the wine sampling if we had known! Yes, it's expensive but like I said, much cheaper than hopping on a trans-atlantic flight, you don't have to learn Italian, and I can honestly say the food is just as good!

(owner) just sent a private message stating that frequent customer's get this special treatment:_____________________""I did attempt to address your comment re: the table you dubbed as ""The King of England"" by sharing with you that it is our ultimate goal each night to excel for every guest. It seems as though you would like more specifics, so as I research further into Friday night's reservations, I see that this table seated 10 minutes after you, is a frequent guest. Our team naturally builds relationships with frequent guests over time, and we take great pride in doing so. Getting to know our guests is a privilege; learning their names and anticipating their preferences for their favorite table, chairs, drinks, bread, etc. Genuine relationships are built when we see someone multiple times a year vs. once, or once a year. We would love the opportunity to build this type of guest-restaurant relationship with you as well; and if we are not able to (since you say you doubt you will be back), we hope you have your special place to go, where you are made to feel like ""The King of England"". ""______________________I guess the rest of us peasants will get the leftover scraps from others. Would hate to see first time guests go to this restaurant and get the same lousy service as us. Maybe when they become a frequent diner they will be treated as royalty.

The setting is intimate which is not surprising given the size of the room but at the same time you do not feel crowded. The room also has a very warm feel.

Well recognized names in all the major categories and, in my opinion, fairly priced. The food and service were also excellent. I started with a ricotta salad that was extremely fresh and tasty. The next dish I had was a risotto with asparagus that was perfectly cooked. The texture and taste were really excellent. My main dish was a sliced steak that was not only flavorful but perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, did not have room for dessert so can't comment. They have a 4 course menu and a seasonal menu and allow you to freely mix and match. Something for every palette.

While we would have loved to have fully experience this, we were on a time crunch. So kudos to the staff for accommodating our schedule!I ordered the beef carpaccio, gnocchi, and the wagyu . The beef carpaccio and gnocchi was out of this world crazy good - definitely the shining highlights of this dining experience for me!! What was majorly disappointing was the wagyu especially when it was $6/ounce and I got 10 ounces! Perhaps it was an oversight on my end but I didn't request medium rare and the wagyu came out well done (however I don't recall our server asking me how I wanted it cooked). The first indicator that the steak was a sad piece of meat was when I tried cutting it, I was struggling for sure. The second, was just the toughness of the bite(s). The third was the lack of flavor. I was extremely bummed because I was really craving a good steak. My friend ordered the ravioli and the salmon and she thoroughly enjoyed everything. She also appreciated the flexibility in choosing items from both the special and standard menu!Despite the wagyu being a let down, I would still highly recommend Veneto to everyone!

Veneto is all around authentic Italian. From the building to the decor to the menus and ordering style. Even the tip is included in the bill, just like Italy! We were warmly greeted by the hostess as if she was expecting us like friends who she was dining with. We were also greeted by one of the owners named Amy. Both welcomed us like we were family coming to dine at their home.  It had about 10 tables set up the night we were there. There were a few large parties that occupied most of the space. Which made it feel more like my Italian family's holidays. Our waiter Patrick, was truly an artisan in his craft. That is not the usual description one would give a waiter. But from the beginning he was helpful and clear. He took his time explaining dishes and which wines he would pair which each. We ended up getting an Antipasti, a first and second course.  After the first glass came out and our antipasti arrived, we knew our waiter knew what he was talking about.  We also knew the chef was a master. Our waiter's recommended wines were perfect! We knew to just trust him from then on. With the first course we were wowed again with his suggestions of wine and the food was so delectable.  We had ravioli stuffed with Ricotta and pears, and topped with grated pecorino I believe. We also had the Gnocchi.  It was amazing in texture and taste. The gnocchi comes in a large portion that two could easily share. However we got to take some home, which I am excited for tomorrow's left overs. The second course was truly the apex for me. I had the Filet Mignon it was garnished delicately and cooked delicately.  It was the best I have ever had. When I took a sip of the red wine he brought out with a bite of the filet, it was like two old friends shaking hands as tastes exploded in my mouth. I almost pulled a meg Ryan from ""When Hairy met Sally"", but it was my wife's birthday and she deserved as few comedic out bursts as possible. Plus we were obviously in a gastronomically sacred place.  My wife had the Striped Bass that once again was perfectly paired with a wine that was so golden and beautiful. It was a white version of Amarone, with basically pressed grapes fermented with pressed white wine ""raisins"" that explode with flavor as they dehydrate. I had a taste, it was a big beautiful wine. We had double cream gelato and a Nutella tart type pastry that went together like they were meant to be ordered that way. Again, thanks to Patrick our waiter. Our 3 hour dinning experience ended with coffee for me and my wife had a macchiato.  We relaxed, laughed and I couldn't have felt more like I did in Italy, where your meal is an event, rather than just what you devour as you talk or don't talk to the other person across the table. As we left, we were met by Amy the owner and the hostess who was holding a bag of our left overs as well as a box of amaretto cookies, for my wife's birthday. It was a very sweet gesture. Amy hugged  my wife like an old friend, and I shook her hand finishing our finest dining experience in Utah. If it wasn't obvious, I recommend this place highly.

So for 3 bottles of wines and a few dishes of food for 5 of us the bill came to $2400 was a lot for SLC pricing.

SLC has always had a dearth of what I would consider Italian food. We have lots of NY red sauce places. That what Italian is to nearly everyone. We have a number of places that claim Italian, but they tend to be more standard fine dining with more pasta. I like that Veneto is straight up being legit Italian.For our dinner the pacing was good. We were not in a rush and wanted to spend time visiting with each other. The prawn dish brought out the largest prawn I've ever seen. The polenta with ragu, perfect. Veal sweetbreads and veal liver. Please. I either didn't see that the bistecca was actually Piemontese beef, or other things looked too good. When you see Bistecca Alla Fiorentina everywhere, realize the magic of this dish is that it is made with a specific breed of cattle with a gene mutation that changes the muscle. It is not as marbled, but it's more tender. If it's angus, waygu, or similar, it's not the real thing and not worth your effort to get it.

Cute house on 900e converted into restaurant.  We had a reservation for 6pm but got there early and Heather the hostess seated us right away and explained the story behind the restaurant and the owners.  There were 12 tables instead, a few out front and great patio in back with more seating. It is small and cozy with understated decor and simple sconces on the wall with curtains in middle of the room to close off and make an area private if needed.AJ was our server and he greeted us promptly and explained the menu and how it would be traditional Italian style service. Slow paced. Multiple coursed. And no tipping allowed (they charge a comperto per person and a service fee).For the antipasti I picked the vegetable tempura and the hubby picked the board with the selection of cured meats. Tempura had peppers onion olives basil and lemon! Hubby loved the olives (i shared with him since I'm not an olive fan) and everything was light and crisp and I loved the light fragrant olive oil that was used to cook the tempura. The meat plate had super thin sliced meats (4 varieties). His favorite was the salami and he enjoyed the pickled onions and peppers served with the platter. It was a great compliment of flavors between the meats and pickled peppers. For the 1st course the hubby got ravioli with cheese and pear and I got the gnocchi. We were expecting it to be small portions like 1 or 2 ravioli but the plate was actually full (8 total).Ravioli was full of flavor and it was an interesting combo with the salty  cheese and the sweet pear inside. Light sauce on the ravioli was not overwhelming nor was it swimming in it. It was the perfect amount of sauce.The gnocchi was soft, thick and creamy cheese combo. Totally different from the potato gnocchi I have had before. Sage butter sauce was thin and just enough to compliment the gnocchi without overpowering the dish. Smoked cheese was a bit heavy and took over the flavor but I still enjoyed the dish.For the 2nd course,  hubby chose the Sliced Beef Filet and I got the veneta salad. I couldn't eat any of the options on the segundi menu so server just brought out the salad with my husband's dish so I didnt have to wait for him to finish his course before I ate mine. The sliced beef had sea salt sprinkled on top. Meat was blackened on the end pieces but the center slices were seared perfectly on edge with warm medium center and the salt just brought out the flavor of the meat. The Veneta Salad was really bitter and a bit too salty for my taste. I couldn't eat it but it's just not my preference (not that there was anything wrong with it).We brought our own cake to celebrate our anniversary and I loved that they let us bring it in and have it even though they sell dessert. However, I checked in with Yelp and got a free sampling of the sbrisolona cookies. So we took a few bites and took the rest home.The part we had the hardest time with was the fact that we couldn't tip and the coperto they charged was only $8 total. The bill for our amazing meal was much cheaper than expected (176) but $8 is not even close to 10% so I feel like we were robbing the server of a well deserved tip. I know they get paid more than typical server but still feel really uncomfortable not tipping more. If we do offer a tip it gets donated.  That is awesome, but I still feel like we shorted AJ on thanking him and the rest of the staff for his incredible service.",4,7/28/2018,Cecilia L.,2,8,1

It has great potential to be a very romantic dining option.Some things we didn't care for....our server was unprofessional. He was nice enough and looked like he was in training but he had a difficult time even reading off the menu options from his notepad. There was no physical menu so the server tried to hurriedly read off the two options per 4 courses all at one. We would have like for him to have paused between the dishes and/or courses so we knew when he had stopped describing one dish/course and started describing another since he described 8 separate dishes one right after another. A menu would be nice to follow along with. I'm not sure if it was his first serving job, he looked and acted pretty uncomfortable...for ~$100 per person ($60+ per person for the Monday set menu + drinks), we expected quality service.

So we told the server who apologized and offered us something different. We ordered something else and next thing we know the server came back and said he and the cook both tried it and said it was cooked correctly. He said it was al dente and how they always cook their risotto. There is a big difference between under cooked and al dente in my opinion. Anyway, they wouldn't comp the risotto, even though we ate less than half of it. At this point we were done and just asked for the check. Weirdly enough, the owner came over to wish me a happy birthday, which was very nice but kind of awkward since we were just told we were wrong in our dislike of crunchy risotto.

The strawberry is very mild in this drink so if you're looking for that, you won't find that here. My tacos are crispy and full of meat and cheese ready to dip in the consome for added flavor. They come with lime, red onions, cilantro, salsa on the side and in the plate with tacos, grilled onions and jalapeños. I've also had their birria ramen which is pretty good. The noodles sat in the broth too long for me for my liking but the flavor was there and bae ate that up quick. I love the consistency here. Whether it was from the store front or the food truck, everything tasted the same! So good and worth my money. Service in the food truck was more pleasant than when I've went to pick up from the store. A couple of the girls in the front seem annoyed when placing an order..almost like it's an inconvenience.

We ordered the Corned Beef with potatoes and funeral potatoes, both dishes had great flavor. The small cup of Funeral Potatoes were served in a small dish/cup and certainly not enough for two people to share. The Corned Beef and potato's were good, but again not enough for two people to share and there were more potato's in the dish than Corned Beef. No deserts were offered. So aside from small portions and no ice- it was ok.",2,7/6/2020,L. T.,0,1,0

We also asked for some bread to sop up the chicken and dumplings gravy (before noticing that the dumplings were a bit more bready than imagined) and they made incredible, buttery, pan-toasted bread.

It was very newly opened the first time we first went and it seems they have worked out the kinks. The cocktails we had were both very good. Cinder and Smoke was brilliant to me but I'm sure it won't appeal to everyone. It tasted like a refreshing fruity BBQ, haha. Brussels Sprouts were great, grits were good again, garlic fries for an app were OK (mostly got them for our two year old) they are super thick potato wedges and I don't really like fries like that. The Trout was AWESOME. I give them huge props for serving it skin side up just daring you to eat the skin, which you absolutely should!!! Fish skin is probably a turn off to most people but give it a try because it is good. The rice and beans with it was   great too. MY OLD REVIEW from June 2017- I got the ""braised pork shoulder"" which it turns out wasn't a shoulder at all but some ribs......but the kicker is that is was bone DRY! I've eaten jerky with more tenderness than whatever I got served. I'm not sure how long you have to ""braise"" a fatty piece of meat like that to turn it into jerky but the one thing it does show is that they must have put  A LOT of time into it. Which brings me to the point of the  incredibly slow service. I had high hopes for this place but it under-delivered big time. $6 for a draft beer seems a bit absurd. We got the cauliflower and grits app and it was definitely the best part of the meal. My wife had the pigs on n a blanket which is impossible to screw up because they do use good sausage from next door at Beltex meats. Watercress salad was pretty solid too but nothing you can't get at any decent restaurant.",4,8/11/2019,Richard M.,0,0,0

Just a Beltex sausage here is fine.My main course was the fried chicken sandwich, there was a bunch of interesting flavors going on. The experience was sloppy, which is not to my personal liking, but the peanut sauce and the slaw did absolutely make the dish something quite different to what I normally expect in a chicken sandwich. I would happily eat this again and furthermore the thick cut steak fries were well-cooked, well-seasoned and delectable. My dining partner ordered the cauliflower and that worked quite nicely with different sweet and savory flavors going on.

When I first went there I discover that it would be faster to get seated if I would have called in to make a reservation. Someone was having a birthday party while a lot of people just walk in and said they have a reservation. Their menu does seem steady with the occasional special rotation. The place is a bit noisy, so speak up or drink up. Best part about this place is that right after brunch, you can go for a walk at liberty park if it is warm enough. Now onto the food. One of my favorite dish is their appetizer. Their cauliflower grits was amazing. The grits was super creamy and cheesy. Very rich and flavorful. The cauliflower has the perfect char to flavor ratio. It goes well with each other. Every bite complimenting each other. The fried chicken and pancakes! Omg! Who would have thought that rolling oats onto fried chicken would give it such a wonderful texture. The mini pancakes has a bit of a sour taste to it, perfect combo with the sweet syrup. This plate was sour, sweet and savory! My tastebuds was off the charts.The corn beef hash! Oh the corn beef hash. So much of everything. Potatoes was nice and soft. The meat was tender. The eggs cooked to perfection. With the oozy yolk pouring onto my dish, I'm just salivating thinking about it. Our server kind of ignored our seat. It's like this table never exited.

We came in for lunch with two people for $80 with tip.Filet Mignon Fajitas - $25 for one person. A massive mound of pepper, onion, tomatoes.

At this point, there is no sense in cooking filet mignon, could use chuck, and it would be just as bad. Also, the portion was way off (see picture). For $25, there should be a lot more meat. It was all pepper and onions. Tortilla was super dry and crusty. Fish tacos - these were good-- great crust on the fish, good flavor. The tortillas were super dry. Corn - delicious. I was expecting it to be on the cobb. It was well mixed in with fajita peppers. Chips and sala- the salsa was good. Chips were average. It would be better if served warm.

After reading the initial reviews, we decided to wait a little bit to give them a chance to work out the kinks before we visited. When we had occasion to celebrate one of life's little victories toward the end of August, Nacho Daddy seemed like the perfect place to do just that. Taking into consideration the horrendous wait times noted by other Yelpers, we elected to call ahead right when they opened to get on the list for a 6:30PM reservation. As it turns out, that move was definitely the way to go on a crowded Saturday night. We overheard as one visitor was told the wait was approximately two hours. Obviously, the limited capacity due to the pandemic is a huge factor here when it comes to wait times for a table. Thankfully, we arrived a little early and were shown immediately to our table which was a high-top right next to the bar. We were greeted after a short wait by our server, Miranda, who was noticeably busy, but still very nice and welcoming. We promptly ordered our adult beverages consisting of a Dos Equis Amber (in the bottle) and a specialty pineapple mint margarita.  Waters came out quickly, but the bar was very slow. In fact, we had ordered and received our food before the drinks arrived. Staying true to our favorite menu item from Las Vegas, we selected the Fiesta Nachos with pulled pork. We love the multi-color chips in this one. We also both ordered chimichangas for an entree. I chose a chicken chimi and my date went with pork (which was regretted almost immediately as ""pork overload""). Sadly, our nachos were lukewarm upon arrival and were way to soggy to eat after only a couple minutes. We flipped them on the plate and soldiered on a bit, but were still disappointed in our most anticipated dish. The drinks arrived just before we flipped the nacho plate. My beer went quickly and I decided against ordering a second round considering the extended wait times with the bar. Instead, I ordered a soda for my follow up beverage and it appeared almost immediately. My date nursed the margarita partially out of respect for the $15 price tag and the flavor was probably not the best selection, though it sounded the most interesting at the time. With the masked mob of onlookers outside growing in number and impatience, we decided to cut our celebration night a little short and give up our table. When the check arrived, the gracious and attentive Miranda had not charged for my soda understanding what happened with the slow bar situation. Fiesta Nachos, two entrees, and two adult beverages ran us a bill just under a Benjamin including tip. The price tag seems much more reasonable in Vegas, but here it was a little North of the norm. We'll be back to share a plate of nachos and maybe some domestic beers next time. Still, it is so refreshing to see something new and different coming to our beloved city.

As for the food, as a vegan, I REALLY appreciate Nacho Daddy having a large vegan menu. I was obsessed with Nacho Daddy as a non-vegan so I am extra happy that I still get to enjoy it as a vegan! Bonus points!! The vegan nachos are so tasty! I love them. My only complaint is that, several tables around me ordered regular, non vegan nachos and their plates were PILED with nachos and fixings. Whereas, our plate of nachos was seriously lacking. It was a pretty small portion considering the size of everyone else's and the cost.

My husband had the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked (med-rare) with a Madeira gastric and duck fat potato fingerlings - absolute perfection! After all the initial snacking, I went light and had the Fuji apple salad which was the most perfect salad I've eaten in a long time.

Our entrees were being served just as the wine was being poured.  My partner was serving the plates (we were sharing family style) and she was pouring the wine over his arm as he was plating. I found this slightly rude, but I didn't say anything.The wine was poured; but in front of us were our cocktail, and water glasses and now big Burgundy wine glasses.  Once again, no one on the floor so I got up and picked up all of the used glasses and brought them to the sideboard (thank god for this side board, it helped me tremendously throughout the evening).  I could not believe the lack of attentiveness.  Maybe it's because my partner is a chef and I am used to seeing how things run in a kitchen and the front of the house.  Dinner is finished, we ordered dessert and a few after dinner drinks.  We are finished with dinner and couldn't wait to get out of there and go to Bar X. I started to feel not well and we went back to our hotel.I have food allergies.  I don't go anywhere near shellfish as it's a life changer for me.  I didn't eat shellfish at the restaurant.  I also don't leave home without my Epi Pen.  By the time I got back to the Hotel I could feel my face and body swelling up; I took my pen and a Benadryl and called my doctor.The next day, I left a very nice message asking to speak to someone due to my incident.  My doctor called me again and asked if I spoke to someone, I said no, they haven't called me back and I would call again.  I called back on Wednesday and spoke to the hostess who told me that Tommy just left the floor and that he would call me back.  Tommy never called me back. I am back in SF with an appointment at UCSF Allergy Clinic.  Clearly, there was cross contamination, but I will never know because no one called me back.When you go out for fine dining, money aside, I think you expect a couple of things.  Good service, nice atmosphere, pleasant and attentive wait staff and to eat without your life being in jeopardy.  This is not that restaurant.  This is a PSA:  If you have any type of Food Allergies, DO NOT COME HERE, your life depends on it.I have pictures, let me know if you want them.EDIT:  Tommy has NOT tried to contact me until this review went up this afternoon.  I have a phone log and it has zero messages from the restaurant or Tommy.",1,2/22/2020,Linda K.,0,0,0

We've been going back for years to celebrate our anniversary and had always enjoyed it tremendously. It was always a bit on the pricey side but the customer service and ambiance made the event very special.This year like most, they printed an anniversary message at the top of two menus for us, always a nice touch that helps us remember the dinner. The artful design of the space, with funky lighting, cool furnishings, and open kitchen added to the experience, making us feel like we were truly In a metropolitan city. But the lighting and furnishings had gone through a makeover making the space a little bland and much less interesting in our view.And then the changed menu was a disappointment. Some of our old favorites were gone, and several items were cooked in duck fat. Yuck!  My best summary of the offerings is shishi comfort food from a hunting lodge. Our calamari and shrimp appetizer, was overpriced and perhaps re-fried. It tasted old and even my wife who loves calamari could not get through half the plate. There were exactly two shrimp in the mix of bad tasting calamari. We did mention it to the waiter and they took it off the bill and we re-ordered something else.My wife's overpriced scallop plate had duck fat fried potatoes with four small scallops, all lined up on the one side of the plate, with a ""fancy squiggle"" of green sauce taking up the other 2/3 of the plate. This gave new meaning to the term ""less is more"" as in less food and more money. To their credit, as always the food presentation was beautiful. My chicken breast was very good. One of the cheaper à la cart main plates but definitely the best food we were served.I had a draft craft beer which was reasonably priced, but my wife ordered two glasses of their house white wine which turned out to be $18 a glass. Admittedly our bad for not paying more attention to the price, we won't make that mistake again. The white wine was an average California wine certainly less than $18 a bottle at the liquor store. I understand the restaurant business is hard and overhead is high, but the price seemed excessive. Speaking of overhead, at one point I counted 10 staff crowded in the kitchen, that's a lot of overhead for the relatively small number of tables in the restaurant.I'm giving them three stars mostly because the customer service is exceptional, but we agreed as we payed the $200 dinner bill (yes $100/person!) that that might be our last dinner there.

Everyone looks uniform, but tattoos and gauges peak through. It operates on a fluid spectrum. You feel me?The dining room consists of an open kitchen (big fan of this), high ceilings, tables, booths and large windows, creating a naturally bright space.Thus far, I've only been here for Brunch, but I've consulted all the menus just to get a feel for the overall offerings. As a vegetarian, lunch and dinner are really limited. Brunch not so much. New American generally seems to focus on taking traditional dishes, with room to color outside of the lines. Lots of great flavor profiles at your disposal. My requirements for service are quite minimal. Were the drinks consistently attended to? yes. Was our waitress available but non intrusive? Yes. Good? Good.As far as I'm concerned, when I see French Toast on the menu, the other choices may as well evaporate into thin air. When I saw ""deep fried"" in front of it, I nearly gasped. And yes, it was very very good, but to keep it gangster with you, not $14 exceptional. However, I was a fan of the dish presentation itself. These were more or less french toast ""sticks"". Which allows for a much more gracious way to devour the goodness. The serving size was perfect. Filling--but appropriate. Coffee was also good, although one small complaint I had. The coffee we picked up in the hotel lobby was much warmer than in the restaurant itself...whoops.Based on reviews, dinner seems to be the must have meal here.

The accompaniments were good and appropriate to the dish, creative, including a delicate hash.The wine menu is good and the waiter suggested the red Obsidian with my elk and that was spot on. Rich and full bodied, yet smooth.  Very enjoyable.Service is very professional and friendly.I recommend this restaurant for its atmosphere, good food and nice relaxed feel.",4,4/14/2019,Tom B.,0,0,0

I thought I wouldn't because I didn't like them in the past. So no third chance for I am a Kumamoto oyster devotee for life. We ordered a Sapporo and a Chu-High. I thought the Chu-High was okay but not my jam. The chicken thigh skewers were juicy the chicken tender was more dry and the pork was good but I thought the flavor of the sauce overwhelmed it. The special charcoal adds the perfect flavor without out being to strong. I ordered Itamemono - Shishito yummy it had bean sprouts and pork belly I recommend this dish. I think my husband thought it should have more pork belly. Anytime pork belly is involved I want more so I agree with him. I ordered 2 sakes the Rihaku (dreamy cloud) Nigori always good and Kikusui Junmai Ginjo also delicious. The set up for the sake isn't a carafe you get a 3.5 pour in a xlg shot glass filled to the brim. Bochum Asian Chive Pancake the best green onion pancake I've ever had.

There were only a few other tables there around 8:30pm on a Wednesday evening. Our Server, Soph, was awesome and was exceptionally helpful in explaining various menu items.We started with a few drinks and a couple oysters. I got a Sapporo and my wife tried the Chu-High mixed drink. The Kusshi Oysters were not our favorite. They had a fairly strong tinny flavor. My wife also didn't really enjoy here Chu-High, I think mostly because of the Barley ShoChu. It was prepared well and looked nice, it just wasn't for her.Then we ordered one each of the Chicken Thigh, Chicken Tenderloin and Marinated Pork Skewers. Next time we'll be sure to order in pairs if we intend to share. They are a pretty small portion. The flavors on each were distinct, deliberate and very interesting. The Marinated Pork had a sauce that had a strong Cumin flavor, which was too much for my wife, but it was definitely one of my favorites. The Chicken Tenderloin was a bit dry and overall my least favorite. The Chicken Thigh was very juicy and delicious, the special charcoal they use is noticeable while not being overpowering at all.Then we had the Itememono (Shisito Peppers, Pork Belly and Bean Sprouts). Again, the flavor was very distinct. Throughout we were impressed by how different each item tasted and how intentional all the flavors seemed. My only complaint with this dish is that I would have liked a little more Pork Belly.At this point we were ready for another round of drinks and I got the Kikusui Sake. My wife got the Dreamy Clouds Sake. The Kikusui is crystal clear, and has a very clean and light flavor. One of the better Sakes I have had although I prefer Hakutsuru (not on the menu) but they are very similar in flavor. Dreamy Clouds is one of my wifes favorites, it is very nice and has a cloudy appearance and a bit of a creamy flavor. They do not provide carafes for the sake but instead bring the empty 3.5oz glass to the table and pour the sake there right up to the brim.We finished with 2 skewers of the Enoki, Buchim (Green Onion Pancake),  and the Bokum (Spicy Rice Cake). I really enjoyed the Enoki, small Mushrooms wrapped in Bacon. Umm. My wife really likes Green Onion Pancakes and said this one was the best she has had. The Spicy Rice Cake was awesome. Spicy but not too much. My wife, who is pretty sensitive to spicy food was able to eat it no problem.This place is not cheap.

The bowl was white rice with pickled ginger, bok choy and some broccolini, roasted corn and what I think is enoki- a little mushroom. What I love about Vietnamese cuisine is that you can really taste the vegetables and the flavors and textures complement and that was the case here as well. The tofu was so good - it probably had been fried because it had the delectably chewy texture folks who like tofu like and those who don't like tofu also like.  I gave 4 not 5 stars because $14 for the tofu bowl seems a little expensive to me with only three chunks of tofu, but the restaurant business is tough and I still have some leftover for lunch tomorrow.

I love having a lot of choices under one roof, and right now, I like that the roof is pretty spacious and you can eat out and still keep plenty of space between you and others. I was stoked to see a new addition to HallPass, with the introduction of Graffito Bao a few months ago. They have an Asian-inspired menu and of course offer a few varieties of bao buns to stay true to their name. The menu is pretty simple, and pretty slick.We opted for the namesake and ordered pork belly bao buns. It's an order of two, with cucumbers, jalapeños, and some slaw. They're sweet, but pork had just a touch of crisp and the spice cuts through the sweet a little. I wish the slaw had a bit more crunch, as the buns and pork both are pretty soft, but the cucumbers to lend a bit of that so it rounds out the experience. An order of two is $8.We also ordered the Vietnamese rolls, which were served with lettuce, Thai basil, mint, carrots, and pickled onions. Such a fun combo and even though the delivery was a bit clumsy (despite following the kind instructions of the staff) it's a really great balance of flavors when it all comes together. I think it was around $10, and together with the bao it was enough for dinner--but we did still have room fore dessert.They have a few bowls, a teriyaki dish, and a soup that all looked very promising. Service was pretty quick, as it was a slow Thursday night. We got our food, found a table away from the cold of the doors, and really enjoyed eating in somewhere while the Jazz beat the Hawks on the TV and Post Malone (the artist, not the building post in the space that is named Malone) played on the sound system. Servers from Beer Zombies were attentive, even though we weren't drinking.Having been a fan of HallPass since pre-day one, I'm excited to see a new concept come in. Once we can go out more often, I'm hopeful that this will become the norm so there are new places to eat all of the time. Graffiti Bao is a perfect example and a great fit.",5,2/4/2021,Jeffrey S.,6,8,0

It was quite dark inside, but not in a dim and damp way. It was more so like a club or bar feeling. The accent lighting made the place feel calm and inviting amidst tables buzzing with conversation,. I especially appreciated the lighting against the warm brick and high, exposed rafters. The service and food: In addition to being seated immediately, we were immediately brought waters and able to put in an order. We got a hot sake for the table, which was so smooth and comforting after our cold walk to the restaurant. I did not like my Lemon Drop Sake cocktail, as it was a bit too sweet and the sake flavor was overpowering. This was my first time eating ramen, so I don't have the ability to compare it to other restaurants or ramen experiences (besides the 99 cent grocery store packets, which definitely is not the same). I only say that for context, but for my first experience, I was blown away by the pure flavor and volume of food. I am a sauce girl. I put sriracha and ketchup on most everything. But this was one of the first times that I did not desire additional sauce with my meal. All three of us ordered and devoured the veggie ramen. The clear noodles were super slurpable, and the corn added some crunch to bites that otherwise just contained broth and shallots. I personally did not like the way the tofu was fried, as the inside of the tofu lacked flavor and a moisture/texture I would have expected of tofu in soup. I would have loved some more hearty vegetables in the ramen, as I ate the whole thing and was pretty hungry three hours later (which is unusual for me). Overall, this was a great experience, and I would go back here. Especially for their $1 chicken wing or $1 gyoza!

I grabbed the Tonkotsu ramen and it was pretty good. The broth had good flavor, and the chasu was great. The service was okay though, and not quite matching up to the food. I ordered dessert and that was obviously forgotten as my check was set in front of me, sans dessert. The person did end up apologizing, so I was like okay, mistakes happen. That's forgivable.Fast forward to today. I stopped by with a friend. It was cold so some good, hot ramen sounded appealing. We arrived early, and there were only 2 tables taken. Sweet! We can get seated right away.We were directed toward the seating in the front with the cold window, so we asked if we could have a table. As I mentioned, we were looking forward to sitting at a table more inside that was warm, plus my friend is tall and those higher seats are not comfortable.Well, we were told that those seats need to be saved for other 'potential' bigger groups so we couldn't sit at the tables. Really? So getting there early in order to beat the rush apparently didn't matter; we apparently need more people to get a table. We just looked at each other in disbelief, then headed out to another place. I doubt we'll be going back after that.Edit:Wow, so apparently I'm a keyboard warrior now. Instead of taking the higher ground and giving their explanation, this is the ""rebuttal"" I get. I have actually eaten at this place before (as pointed out the beginning of my review).

They do a really perfect table to take a photo at, if you are lucky you might get that table for the optimal insta foodie photo. I wasn't that lucky and sat at the bar.The drinks here are very good. I didn't know how I feel about them diluting the sake in front of me. I was concerned about how much water I got in drink versus sake. Even the employees joked about a cup of clear liquid if it's sake or water. The food here is decent. Cheap appetizers (dumplings and wings) and their noodles are decent. I got their curry noodles. The curry was good. The noodles was cooked to perfect texture. The meat was seasoned very well as well. And the egg was cooked to perfection. The service here is a very hit or missed. Even though everyone was just standing in front of me behind the bar. They were busy talking and ""training"" than helping me. I had to wave at them and raised my voice a little to get attention.

Great food, fun atmosphere....but that's all.Update to my review:As we can see, the owner didn't appreciate my review and now I'm here clarifying my sarcasm. I do understand if that they would need to explain my diluting comment. The way they were pouring the sake into another bottle and then following a joke about it being water got me concern. I didn't came up with that conclusion without listening to that comment. Maybe don't joke around about diluting in front of customers.

Maybe that night was just an off night for the gnocchi, but she still enjoyed it.   Other thoughts, the fried chicken sounds very interesting on paper but the asian flavors are not as pronounced as you'd imagine. The steak should be passed up for the lamb for sure.

Not only does it mean I get to try more items (especially when you have several people), but the chefs also seem to put so much care into each dish. My theory is that because it is just a portion of a full meal, each item is handled with more care... For example, the vegetable gets a sauce of its own and extra garnishes that it wouldn't get as a mere side on a normal plate of food. As someone who doesn't eat meat, I love going to places like this and just reveling in the beauty of veggies. I love well-cooked veggies, and this place did a great job glorifying some of our common vegetables.I tried the charred beets, grilled asparagus and fried cauliflower. Wow, double wow and triple wow. All were excellent, but my favorite was probably the cauliflower. The caper raisin vinaigrette on it was amazing, as was the whipped ricotta. I was raving about all the sauces on the dishes so much that the waiter brought me bread to eat the leftover sauces with (the bread was delicious of course)!The asparagus was heavenly. It was perfectly charred and cooked to the point of tenderness, but not chewy like can happen with asparagus. The jalapeno aioli in it made me stop and sigh after trying it. It's THAT good. The poached egg on top was a perfect compliment. I got the dish without the pancetta. The beets were excellent as well.

Last night I went for the first time in roughly 3 years and it seems to have gone down in genuine quality of food. Don't get me wrong, it's presented nicely and it's still decent and ok, but not worth the high prices. They have shrunken their portion sizes, already smaller than they were, because it's a tapas style restaurant, which was quite disappointing. They changed their menu, keeping only a couple staples available. Among those staples, the potato gnocchi was and is my favorite. My boyfriend was turned off by the amount of truffle oil that they douse the entree with, however, and they served 6 gnocchi total in the dish which is much smaller than it used to be - when the dish came out, it looked bare. As for new menu options, the cabbage wrapped dish was alright - something you could make at home. Calamari was pretty good and is more for the adventurous eater, I do recommend. The ribs were among our tables favorite and worked out with our 3 party table because there were only 3 ribs. The dessert cheesecake came in a mason jar with a lemon jello-like topping. The topping was overpowering and not something any one of us cared for. The cheesecake itself was good once you got hallway down past the goo on top.Out of 5 or 6 cocktails available, my party of three tried 3 of them and all of them seemed lackluster in some way. I'm all for a good mezcal, but the ""rodeo ghost"" was hard to finish. The execution on mixology just wasn't there. Service was great. I really enjoyed our waiter. I'm forgetting his name but he was quite personable and gave suggestions when asked.

Service is decent and they make do with the close quarters they have to work with. Kudos.Overall I'd normally say it's a 3 star but because of the ratio of high price compared to portion size is so off, that takes a major hit.

Who knew an arepa could be so full??

Most people trying them for the first time definitely find them unique and I think that 50% of people who have never tried plantains love them and the other 50% wouldn't get them twice (their loss). So if you're very vanilla, skip the plantains.A minor critique, given with the utmost respect::I found the Reina Pepiada to be somewhat undersalted in the couple if times I've had it.

The staff was great and very welcoming as we naturally are. Some of the things were okay, such as the patacon, but some things were lacking in flavor. For example, we had to use a ton of guasacaca on our tequeños because they didnt really have flavor. They're also a bit expensive, but my husband tells me that is usually do to their location downtown. Me encanta que SLC finalmente se esté volviendo más diverso y, como Venezolana, realmente quería que me gustara este lugar.  Los dueños fueron excelente como naturalmente lo somos.  Algunas de las cosas estaban bien, como el patacón, pero algunas carecían de sabor.  Por ejemplo, tuvimos que usar bastante guasacaca en nuestros tequeños porque realmente no tenían sabor.  También son un poco caros, pero mi esposo me dice que eso suele afectar a su ubicación en el centro de SLC.",3,1/19/2020,Letisia S.,0,1,0

We were greeted upon entry and the customer service throughout the 1 1/2 hours we were there was great. I appreciated the smiles, conversation and item knowledge from the staff. It makes a visit to any establishment that much better!I love the menu is split into sections for easy and quick ordering. I love when menus aren't too cluttered with items that they do ""alright"" and filled with a few items they do amazingly. That is definitely a plus here. They also have veggie options for those that live that lifestyle or want a meatless day. I had the grilled steak arepa and guava & cheese tequenos. B O M B. My arepa was fried (fry all the things!) and the steak was nice and tender. I took out a couple things that I'm not fond of and it came out correctly. The avocado sauce and garlic sauce that's out on the tables were such a great addition to the flavors already in the food. I could literally drink the both of those! I'm a dipper so it was a nice touch on the tequenos as well. I also ordered the shredded beef, ground beef and potato & cheese empanadas to go and when they were consumed, it was SO good even without all my dipping sauce needs. Not burnt at all, golden and crispy as they should be. They have canned beverages in the cooler and a water jug by the register in case soda isn't your thing.The decor is beautiful!

But then again, this place is new. Of course, as is the case with all restaurants by now, they were practicing good Covid measures, like mask wearing and social distancing.The item that immediately caught my attention was this ""Triple of Won Won"", which included Chicken w/ Snow Peas and Carrots, Honey Walnut Shrimps and Black Pepper Steak...plus your choice of White, Brown and Fried Rice. All this for only 16 bucks! I also ordered their Mango flavored Iced Tea, and it was also beautifully presented, in a tropical glass.More than anything, I loved the Honey Walnut Shrimps...so much better than what I anticipated! Didn't care too much for the Chicken w/ Snow Peas and Carrots, but liked the Black Pepper Steak. I just love variety, and this sure delivered on that! I only wish we could have substituted some of the meats in the ""Triple"". Still, I love how I got to try these items that I normally don't order on Chinese menus. Topping all this was the amazing presentation in this fancy red tray...Loved it! All such a great idea!!As if all this wasn't enough, they even gave me a complimentary dessert, Mochi Ice Cream! I actually forgot to take a pic of it, but it was a perfect ending to a great meal.BTW, the service was amazing as well. Overall, this place double ""Won"" me over.

We chose takeout over dining in. I would've given three stars but I think they'll perfect their game soon enough and I feel like 3 stars over 4 can negatively affect a business (which has employees and families to feed). The reason for ""three"" stars is that the fried rice we ordered had no ham, egg, or peas in it. Just fried rice. Eh. The walnut shrimp was overloaded with a cream sauce that made it a little too gooey. And the seasame chicken was decent chicken, but there was barely any sauce on it. I hope they take a tip from their Thai neighbors at Skewered and spend a little more time perfecting the ingredients in their dishes. Downtown SL needs an awesome Chinese spot and I'm confident that trolley square will hold them up. For now, I will keep this post here and remove it once they've mastered their dishes. Until then, go enjoy yourself at their awesome looking restaurant and let me know if I'm just too picky. Thanks!Update: The super sweet team at Won Won replies letting us know that they're perfecting their dishes. My husband picked up the food and said their staff is absolutely wonderful. They're on their way to absolute perfection and we're 100% supporters. Changing this review shortly. Thanks to their team for reaching out.",4,3/11/2020,Ren N.,2,1,0
