# <p style="text-align: center;">Introduction</p>

The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has transformed many aspects of daily life. As a consequence of this virus being a novel pathogen, no standard, clinically-tested treatments and pharmaceutical interventions were available at the time its transmission was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March of 2020. To mitigate its transmission and propagation the human species has had to turn to behavioral and social modifications. The three most commonly recommended being: wearing face coverings, physical distancing of six feet, and avoidance of groups of individuals. The last two recommendations have had a large impact on the restaturant industry with many being closed for dine-in services for extended periods of times and having to resort to other means of business transactions (e.g. delivery and pick-up options). To try and gain insight on how business have adapted to the pandemic and how customers have responded to the changes we chose to analyze a data set consisting of data gathered from Yelp about restaurants in the Salt Lake CIty area. Yelp is a service hosting crowd-sourced reviews for various types of businesses. In this project we used YelpAPI and scraperdog to scrape our data. The main objectives of our present analysis are:<br>
* Basic exploration of the data set.
* Calculate the count for the various food categories of restaurants in the data set. 
* Discovering which restaurant in the data set have high or low average ratings.
* Explore ratings pre-pandemic and during the pandemic using March 2020 as the time of separation.
* Determine what dining options restaurants are offering.
* Determining whether customer reviews/ratings were positive or negative when mentioning the pandemic.
